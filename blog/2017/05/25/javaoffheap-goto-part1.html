    <p>I had the honor to be a guest
on <a href="http://www.javaoffheap.com/">Java OffHeap</a>
(<a href="http://www.twitter.com/offheap">@offheap</a>) while
attending <a href="/blog/blog/2017/04/19/goto-chicago-picks.html">Goto Chicago 2017</a>.  I am also
happy to announce that I am in talks with the OffHeap guys to have an
occasional guest segment on their program, tentatively called "Mark and
Sweep" where we will feature audio content from the existing interviews
from my book <a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/purchase.html">Secrets
of the Rockstar Programmers</a> as well as new interviews with
additional thought leaders.</p>

<h2>Part I: Georges Saab and I</h2>

<p>02:58 I talk about the java.net sunset.  03:54 I mention that the
email lists were still not ready at the time of the recording
(now <a href="https://javaee.groups.io/g/javaee">now they are</a>).  I
also mention the essential nature of the search archive for JCP mailing
lists.  This gives an insight into one of the challenges of evolving a
multi-year project over many releases.  04:37 I explain why we couldn't
use Google Groups. 05:25 I call for a moment of silence for the memory
of java.net.  05:58 I mention you can submit pull requests, but the
governance process is not yet in place for external commits.  06:19
Georges explains that openjdk was never running on java.net, and so is
not impacted.  06:58 Georges explains why they are not moving to GitHub
from Mercurial.  They have everything working well enough with
Mercurial, so there is no need to move it over to GitHub.  07:58 I
mention that we gave up using JIRA when moving to GitHub, and I asked if
anyone was using <a href="http://waffle.io/">waffle.io</a> as an agile
  overlay on top of GitHub.  No one was.</p>

<p>08:58 Bob asked about the transition to the "train release".  Georges
mentioned that we work on things in OpenJDK, and then take it to JCP for
standardization.  We're not changing that way of doing things.  10:32
Georges tells the story of how there is a diversity of opinions
regarding release cadence.  11:42 Many of the things in 9 enable the
more rapid release model.  12:07 Freddy explains how this evolved across
the java releases.  12:48 Georges explains the "medicine to candy
ratio".  9 has more medicine and not as much candy.  14:00 Georges
explains how this benefits the community as a whole.  It enables the
small things to get out more quickly without waiting for big blockbuster
releases.  15:00 He uses the 2016 delay of 9 as how it blocked things
like String compaction.  15:30 I mention the rapid sunset schedule for
Java 8 itself.  16:00 George observed September 2017 is end of public
updates for 8, but most of the criteria will not be met.  17:03 Bob
provides some insight on the corporate adoption angle.  18:27 Georges
pitches modularizaion's benefits.  It mitigates the need to
call <code>sun.misc.unsafe</code>.  21:11 Freddy mentioned why people
use it: it makes it even <b>possible</b> to consider Java.  It makes the
performance <b>acceptable</b> compared to alternatives.  22:27 Freddy
mentioned that the current plan is to provide standard alternatives
before removing <code>sun.misc.unsafe</code>.  22:38 Georges talks about
the support burden on unsafe and device driver control for
  Minecraft.</p>

<p>26:24 Bob brings up the IBM and RedHat plan to vote no on Jigsaw, as
it relates to language development.  Georges provides some color.  27:55
Freddy asks what's the biggest complaint from IBM and RedHat.  28:59
Georges mentions the perils of scope creep.  29:46 Freddy asks what was
  the outcome?  30:42 Georges answers. </p>

<p>32:30 Freddy asks, if you want to have faster startups, do you have
to use Jigsaw?  32:40 Georges answers use jlink and ahead of time
compilation.  By using jlink, you are telling the system what you are
actually using.  33:29 Bob points that JCP and jigsaw can conflict
because the releasing of Java subsets is prohibited according to legal
rules.  Georges answers: 8 introduced "compact profiles".  Nobody has
complained about that.  Jlink is essentially a program doing that.
Jlink is for you to use to package the application.  35:20 Bob asks how
  small can it get?</p>

<p>36:38 Ed tells the story of the acute need for a module system in EE.
The notion of having of modules would have influenced the design of EE.
37:35 Ed tells the story of the ALPN backport story.  Every decision
that is made has ripple effects down the pipeline.  38:57 Georges
elaborates more on the train idea.  "Marbles stuck in the tube behind
the basketball".  The heart of the train release idea is that when
features are ready, they can be released.  To see what's coming, look at
the JEPs.  There is a minimum amount of time for JCP releases.  They are
looking at possibly shortening that minimum. <code>Ed personally notes:
    <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a>.</code></p>


<p>42:49 Project Valhalla: value types and data representation.  45:15
How this relates to the ends of the spectrum: micro services and really
big data.  45:42 Freddy likes value types, in particular its cache
  friendliness.</p>

<p>46:00 Project Panama: JNI done right.  Generate ability to call into
java from header files.  47:35 this plus value types is pretty
  compelling.</p>

<p>48:12 Status of JShell: it's in 9.  49:17 JShell removes all the
ceremony of getting started with Java.  We'll use things we learn from
  that to understand where we actually need the ceremony and don't.</p>
