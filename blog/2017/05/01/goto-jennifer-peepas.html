    <p>Teaches people to collaborate to make art.</p>

<p>We grew up labeled as smart which is good, but sometimes people
forget to teach us things because they assume you already know it or can
  look it up yourself.</p>

<p>CaptainAwkward.com is about learning or re-learning stuff we think we
"should" know, no shame about it.</p>

<h2>Anecdata</h2>

<p>People tell me their work feedback woes.</p>

<p><b>Managers</b>: having to conform to HR feedback processes that are
  overly brittle.  Or, the converse, there is no process.</p>

<p><b>Creators/Developers</b>: "Looks good to me".  This means they
  haven't had time to look at the work.</p>

<p><b>Peer reviewers</b>: some people can't take any criticism.  Some
  people are too nitpicky.  </p>

<h2>Dealing with Feedback</h2>

<p>How she does feedback with her students.  Listed the steps.</p>

<p>Ask the creators why do feedback?  Make the work better.</p>

<p>Actually, the secret is an emotional component.  Actually, there is
significant benefit to the reviewers in how they create their own
  work.</p>

<p>You see your own work differently when you see how others respond to
  it.</p>

<h2>How to do Feedback Better</h2>

<p>Liz Lerman's Critical Response Process.</p>

<p>1. View the work.  Work speaks for itself.</p>

<p>2. Audience describe what you observe without assigning a value
  judgement.</p>

<p>3. Audience talks about what's working</p>

<p>4. Creator: ask advance prepared questions </p>

<p>5. Audience: identify things that aren't working, with the author's
  consent.</p>

<p>This process forces people to slow down the process and look at the
  big picture before diving into the details.</p>

<h2>Good Practices</h2>

<p>Critique sessions happen at regular intervals, with advance notice,
  and a firm start and end time.  It's not a pop quiz.</p>

<p>Structure and ground rules are agreed-upon and transparent.</p>

<p>Can be in-person meeting or online discussion.</p>

<p><b>No multitasking during the review.  No hiding in your
    phone.</b></p>

<p>Have one person be responsible for facilitating the discussion.</p>

<p>Creators my introduce the work but not apologize for it.  Nobody
  wants your shame spiral.</p>

<p>After work is presented, facilitator can give participants a few
  minutes to write down/type up their thoughts before anyone speaks.</p>

<p>If you're the creator, use those minutes when everyone is writing to
  generate and organize questions you have for the audience.</p>

<p><b>The goal of the session is to generate the todo list to carry the
    project forward.</b></p>

<h2>If you are giving feedback...</h2>

<p>If you could only five three notes, what would they be?</p>

<p>Focus on the work, and not the person or their individual performance
  or abilities.</p>

<p>Avoid, "That won't work because...".  Instead, as them why they are
doing it that way.  Try to stay focused on the future, what needs to
  happen next.</p>

<p>If you raise a problem, try to also propose a solution.</p>

<p>Facilitators make it safe for people to say, "I don't know".</p>

<p>Is it true, is it necessary, is it kind.</p>

<h2>What if it really stinks</h2>

<p>Be brief, direct, and specific.</p>

<p>Shame and blame are performance killers.</p>

<h2>If you're receiving feedback</h2>

<p>Write it all down.  Write it down even if you disagree.</p>

<p>If you feel yourself getting flustered or defensive, cut yourself
  slack, but also, stop talking.</p>

<h2>If you're the moderator</h2>

<p>Keep the discussion on time.</p>

<p>Amplifying the good quesions is a better strategy, than tamping down
  on the negative one.</p>

<p>Aftercare for Creators</p>

<p>After the session, take a break.  Then refine the comments.
  Prioritize the feedback, do the easy stuff first.</p>

<p>If you need to discard the feedback item, you can make a better
  argument for doing so if you show you considered it.</p>

<p>Good feeedback doesn't just happen.  It needs a structure.</p>

<p>The best possible outcome from a response session is for the maker to
  want to back to work.  Liz Lerman</p>

<p>Thorough feedback is a gift of time and attention.  It's an
investment in the projects you make and in your development as a
creator.</p>
