    <p>Raw notes from Cloud Debugging
with <a href="http://twitter.com/patricknflynn">Patrick Flynn</a>.  Java
Tools Tech Lead on Java Cloud Platform.</p>

<p>Picture from good old days, 2003.  Hardware was very manual.
Purchase orders, procurement, six months later.  Cork board to separate
  motherboards.</p>

<p>Tooling was also not good back then.</p>

<p>Did show of hands about who is doing deployments by hand.</p>

<p>Today, we can provision in a matter of seconds.  Great network
infrastructure, great physical security, but if you are deploying
  manually, you are still not getting all the benefits.</p>


<p>Asserts that spring boot is the platform of choice in the community
right now.  Deployed as jars, not wars.  Demo.
Takes <code>DataStore</code>, a google cloud platform feature.  Puts a
  value to the data store and displays it.</p>

<p>Mutates the demo to add translation.  It is a available as a maven
dependency in maven central.  Had to look up the javadoc, out of the
IDE.  Restarted spring boot because of dependency added.  Added language
  detection iteratively.</p>

<p>Google cloud tools for intellij has support for a number of services.
  Plugged these heavily.  Cloud source repositories, for example.</p>

<p>App Engine Flex.  Create Deployment Configuration: Went through lots
of the fields in this dialog.  Points: Good maven support.  Need an
appengine-web.xml.  On build, this actually orchestrates a Docker build.
The system looks at the project type and chooses the right Docker image
  to run it.  This is a bit slower than App Engine Standard.</p>

<p>Mentioned the vendor lock in concern.  App Engine Flex is not a
walled garden.  It allows running arbitrary APIs.  Because it depends on
  Docker, you can take your output to any other cloud.</p>

<p>Google built Borg as a container running service.  Kubernetes was
informed by the design of Borg.  How do you run the Spring Boot demo on
Kubernetes?  He went into the gcloud CLI and created a bunch of stuff to
  run it.  This is entirely separate from App Engine Flex.  </p>


<p>Showed how the debugger gets enabled: Adding the cloud debugger agent
into the Dockerfile.  The service name and the project file are included
  in the dockerfile so the debugger knows about it.</p>

<p>Supports GitHub integration.</p>

<p>Demo used the spotify Docker Maven Plugin.  Need to include
source-context.json and source-contexts.json.  Demo also includes a
docker push to the container registry for the google cloud
  project.  Did the mvn deploy from the cloud platform machine.</p>

<p>Additional kubernetes steps: Expose load balancer.  </p>

<p>Showed lots of mutations of the config on kubernetes and App Engine
Flex.  Showed how easy traffic splitting, canary testing, and
  versioning works.</p>


<p>Used Apache Bench to generate load.</p>

<p>With no time left, he finally got to the debugging.  Bug: reporting
wrong user agent.  Shows how in Intellij you can attach to running
instances.  It syncs the source to what is actually running in the
cloud.  This works because the agent captures what the breakpoints are,
captures the sample at the time when it is hit.  It is not interactive
debugging.  You can't step.  But it's still better than nothing.</p>
