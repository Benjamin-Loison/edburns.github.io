    <p>I use GoDaddy for my DNS hosting for this site.  I'm interested in
Container as a Service (CaaS).
This <a href="https://thenewstack.io/godaddy-built-container-service-platform/">podcast
    episode</a> seems like a good fit.  Here are my notes as I listen.</p>

<p>0:33 uses Kubernetes and OpenStack.  Shaheeda Nizar, director of
engineering, GoDaddy.  Micah Rupersburg, GoDaddy CaaS engineering
  leader.</p>

<p>1:53 Why did you start to do it?  They already had IaaS powered by
OpenStack.  Internally, the adoption of containers took
off: <strong>mainly because of being able to package all the
dependencies</strong>.  Once they went down this road, they needed a
  platform that runs, orchestrates and manages these containers.</p>

<p>03:33 High level overview.  Kubernetes started to take off as they
were entering the space.  They liked the vibrant community.  They build
Kubernets clusters on top of their OpenStack compute.  It had to be
multi-tenant (obviously for GoDaddy).  This requirement caused much of
  their interesting technical decisions.</p>

<p>04:57 They needed to get the efficiencies of scale.  Needed partition
and isolation.  Kubernetes namespaces allows this.  They use namespaces
to segregate the teams from one another in production.  In staging, they
create one namespace for each instance of their entire stack that they
  want to test.  It can be torn down all at once.  It's a sandbox.</p>

<p>06:51 Uses ActiveDirectory for group memberships and Keystone
  (OpenStack) for authorization.  They have a custom shim that
  syncronizes the ActiveDirectory into the authorization bit of
  Kubernetes to provide RBAC.  Each team only has one role.  All team
  members have all rights.  Driven by an annotation on the namespace
  object.  Does that mean it's Java?</p>

<p>07:50 What about "Nova" (a part of OpenStack).  Did you drop that?
  Seemed like a sensitive question.  She kind of equivocated.  They may
  adopt a hybrid cloud approach: running Kubernetes on their own
  private cloud, but OpenStack on the public cloud and be able to
  deploy in both places.</p>

<p>08:45 Kubernetes provides isolation to give you cloud portability.
  For example L7 load balancing has different impls on AWS vs their
  impl, but the app's are isolated from that.  IP space is normalized.
  They use DNS for service discovery.  They are scoped to the
  namespace.  The federation feature of Kubernetes can be integrated
  with DNS.</p>

<p>10:11 Drilling down on the hybrid environment.  Clients have to care
  about if they have to be in different regions.  If the client is in a
  region for which GoDaddy does not have a regional presence, they want
  to be able to go after that business by using public cloud for that
  client.</p>

<p>11:25 Much of the demand is driven by latency.  For example,
  GoDaddy's main thing is searching for the availability of domain
  names.  When someone does a query, it needs to be handled local to
  you.  They don't have data centers in all the places they want to do
  business.</p>

<p>12:25 How do you handle the data synchronization?  They are not even
  looking at doing that.  The data is still local.  Are you referring
  to data governance?  If so, still to premature to talk about.
  Distributed database sync is the real problem.  Domain resellers need
  a local endpoint to call.</p>

<p>15:05 Which are running in hybrid mode?  The multi-tenant thing is
  still a year out.  Some apps originated as containerized, others were
  broken up from monoliths.  They are good experts at stateless
  microservices apps that are containerized.</p>

<p>16:55 Autoscaling and resiliency to failure is such a huge win for
  product teams.  Services have better uptime.  No paging in the middle
  of the night.  Better response time.</p>

<p>18:07 What do you use to gain visibility into what is inside the
  containers?  For example, how do you know your containers have the
  latest security patches applied?  They have a monitoring system:
  metrics, logging events out (audit trail).  But they basically don't
  keep track of what's inside containers.  They have a CICD pipeline
  into which such inspection could be inserted.  They have standard
  approved versions of frameworks.  Kubernetes allows you to deploy in
  different ways, though.</p>

<p>21:42 How important is telemetry.  Snap and Grafana.  There is debate
  within Kubernetes about CI.  They are using Jenkins for CI and CD.
  They are not using Travis.  They run their own Git servers.  They
  use <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a> to collect
  metrics.  They have a plugin that allows you to collect metrics from
  all the containers in the cluster, and these metrics are federated to
  a central location.  Grafana sits on top of that.  Each team can look
  at a dashboard that represents their namespace.</p>

<p>24:03 As soon as a client gets onboarded, they get their own
  dashboard.  </p>

<p>24:50 How are you managing the control plane?  They looked at Magnum,
  but rolled their own using Ansible.  There are several different
  layers for the CaaS.  At the network layer they use Flannel SDN,
  backed by EtcD.  They deploy EtcD and Flannel before they deploy
  anything else.  On top of that they deploy the Kubernetes control
  plane.  On top of Kubernetes itself, they deploy all the ancialliary
  services.  (Platform services).  They hope to make this available to
  the community.</p>

<p>27:54 How do you decide what to share?  1. Not re-invent. 2. Use
  open source that's the right fit.  They have custom code for legacy
  tie-ins.  But the intention is to write it in a standardized way.
  There is a huge benefit of sharing if it gets popular.  The community
  can maintain the pattern.  She thinks of it as a two way street.</p>

<p>29:33 Are you still using any proprietary for new developments?  LDAP
  integration is custom.  SSL certificates or DNS entries.  CaaS has the
  smallest number of proprietary bits.  They
  use <a href="http://www.fluentd.org/">FluentD</a> to collect their
  logs with
  a <a href="https://www.loggly.com/blog/why-journald/">JournalD</a>.</p>

<p>31:35 They have a custom logging infrastructure but they wrote a
  wrapper around it that looks like ElasticSearch.</p>

<p>32:05 How much of what is in the container do you want to provide as
  a service?  Is every product group on their own there?  The web based
  product teams are rolling their own stuff and they have a lot of
  expertise in that area.  They don't have a lot of visibility into the
  actual application teams.  But they do have patterns for best
  practices such as "how do I terminate SSL in my application with
  NGINX?"  "How do I send events out?"  "How do I expose my metrics?"
  They have tutorials for how to do this kind of thing.  It's really a
  pattern library.  They want to make it so the only thing they need to
  interact with is Kubernetes to do anything involving deployment.  One
  single YAML and you're good.  Deploying straight to OpenStack has lots
  of steps.  These go away with their CaaS solution.</p>

<p>34:50 What is the business value of the service itself?  How is it
  priced?  Who are the customers?  They measure the business impact in
  1. time to market.  If developers can deploy their apps in a seamless
  low friction environment, that's the win.  IT has transferred from a
  "ticket based" thing where developers had to do a lot of those
  tickets before they could deploy their app to production.  All of
  that friction goes away.  2. The cost of devops.  How much work does a
  dev or op have to put in to ensure the service is always up, is
  scaling correctly, has sufficient monitoring.  </p>

<p>37:03 What's next?  Healthchecking. <strong>The old downstream
    problem shows up again!</strong>  How do we expose that type of
    failure.  They are looking at ways to make this transparent, with
    probing endpoints.  Making root cause analysis easier.  Elastic
  capacity is not done yet.</p>

<p>39:22 The same tired value proposition: let developers focus on their
  code and not have to worry about the environment.  What
  about <a href="https://github.com/funcatron">Funcatron</a>?</p>

<p>39:46 Kubernetes is a great platform to build higher level
  constructs on top of.  Machine learning on top of the cluster.</p>
