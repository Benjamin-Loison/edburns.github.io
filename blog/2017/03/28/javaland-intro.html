    <p>Fried Saacke, kicked off JavaLand 2017 today.  It's totally full, and
in a new theater within Fantasialand.  We have 110 lectures, 8 workshop
sessions, and 16 community activities this year.  He admitted that not
everything will go as smoothly as we might like, but we are doing the
  best.  The biggest practical challenge is throughput.</p>

<p>He talked about DukeCon, which may be a separate conference, but
  currently is an online sidecar with JavaLand.</p>

<p>Tobias Frech talked about the community activities: exchange with
  eachother.  In the Quantum show floor.</p>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>Java Innovation Lab
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Meet the JUGS
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Early Adapter's Area
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Workshops
	  </p></li>
          
          
	</ul>

<p>16:30, Group photo outside Quantum</p>

<p>Use the #JavaLand twitter handle.</p>

<p>German speaking JavaLand slack group
#jlca.  <a href="https://slackin-jvm-german.herokuapp.com/">Click
    here</a>.  Ask here where you can win a robot.</p>

<p>This year they had a JavaLand4Kids day before the conference.</p>

<p>Some more numbers about speakers, staff, exhititors,
  sponsors, student helpers.</p>

<p><strong>He specially called out that he invited Oracle to be a sponsor, but
    they declined.</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>Digitialization of the REWE Group</p>

<p>Mentioned the importance of being a good server leader.  So glad to
  see him mention this.</p>

<p>Three big digitializaion efforts before joining REWE.  Related his
recruitment story from REWE group.  Key point: never compromise, at all.
But this is in conflict with the notion of being a servant leader.  He
keeps mentioning that life is short.  Mentions you are only as good as
  you think you are.</p>

<p>Listed some business numbers for REWE.  Lines of business: Food
  retail, Tourism, DIY.</p>

<p>Car analogy: if the car keeps driving ok, why fix it?</p>

<p>What does he mean by digitalizaion?  Related ProMarkt story: Metaphor
of Bezos cuckold story.  Basically: take on the "software is eating the
world" meme and reorganize the company according to it.  Story: how he
asked them to change the company car policy.  This is an example of the
  changes he was trying to bring.</p>

<p>Similar story: the corporate suite and the whiteboard: he did not
  compromise.</p>

<p>I would like to him to give more details of what they do from day to
  day.  It was all about the environment.</p>

<p>Now he gets to it.  Slide showing non-digital businesses and
corresponding digitalized business.  Old: World of Music, ProMarkt,
Gortz, Morrisons.  New: iTunes, Spotify, amazon, zalando, ocado.
Mentioned the he will sell his Morrisons shares short.  Morrisons: they
compromised by partnering with Ocado and Amazon.  They are giving all of
their knowledge away to someone who is going to eat you in the next
years.</p>

<p>Have to rethink the whole business.  Starting with: what is a store?
He thinks of it as a mini warehouse that is perfectly positioned in
neighborhoods.  Difference between self service business and service
business.  Gave an aside: build your technology yourself.  Don't buy
  from vendors, otherwise you become too constrained.</p>
