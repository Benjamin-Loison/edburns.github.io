    <p>Last year, at JavaOne 2016, I had the honor of unlocking
the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/rock-star-wall-of-fame.html#burns">JavaOne
Rockstar</a> achievement.  2017 was my first JavaOne after that, and I
can say that the experience wasn't any different from the previous
sixteen or so years I've been blessed to speak: exhausting, informative
and inspiring.  This blog post reviews the sessions I attended and
  presented and shares my thoughts and notes if I have them.</p>

<h2>Sessions</h2>

<p>The Sunday of JavaOne has always been a day for the Java community to
  shine and share their work and highlights from the previous year.
  This year, the day was formally labeled "Developer Community Day".
  Some differences from last year: it was not formally billed as
  "NetBeans Day", all the talks were from non-Oracle speakers, all from
  the community, there was a whole lot of JUG content, there were
  several "career focused" talks.</p>

<h3>Sunday</h3>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON2197&showEnrolled=false">Java, the JCP, and You [CON2197]</a></h4>

<p>Heather Vancura, director of the JCP, asked me to co-present at this
session about how to get involved in the JCP, the official way that the
community brings its ideas into the Java platform.  The JCP is better
than ever at this job, so with Java EE moving to the Eclipse Foundation
as EE4J, it is a very exciting time for the Java Community Process.</p>

<h4><a href="https://oracle.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON5074">Event Sourcing with JVM Languages [CON5074]</a></h4>

<p>Rahul Somasunderam shared his experiences working with Event
Sourcing, a technique of treating logs as the source of truth for a
software system, rather than some other kind of persistent store such as
a database.  Rahul has created
the <a href="https://github.com/rahulsom/grooves">Grooves</a> framework
to provide this abstraction.  Here are my raw notes.  The presentation
  is available in the content catalog link above.  The presentation source is available at <a href="https://bit.ly/2017-es">bit.ly/2017-es</a></p>

<ul>
  
<p>Needed a java based event sourcing solution, looked around in 2016,
  nothing fit.</p>

<p>Definition: treat your database like you treat your logs.</p>

<p>Everyone is comfortable looking at logs.  Log files: you can create
  entrys and read them.  You cannot update or delete entries.</p>

<p>Bad example 1: bank account balance.  @Transactional usage.</p>

<p>Scan of old school German bank passbook.  Great example of a log.
  This is what event sourcing should be doing in any domain.</p>

<p>But that was banking.  If you look at your logs and debug your
application, you are doing event sourcing in your mind.  Banks defined
  their business model hundreds of years ago.</p>

<p>Aggregate: Account.  Events: Transcation, AtmWithdrawl.  Snapshot:
  AccountSummary.</p>

<p>Computing snapshots: S sub N = f(S0, E1..EN)</p>

<p>The way to take your log and play it forward.</p>

<p>Incremental snapshots.  Use an existing Snapshot as an input entry in
  computing a new snapshot.</p>

<p>Revert.  You can't delete events but you can have new events that
  represent deletes.</p>

<p>Bad Example 2: Joins in event sourcing.</p>

<p>Grooves domain objects: Aggregates.  Also uses RxJava
  Observables.</p>

	<ul>

	  <li>Some code examples that basically show how to do ORM using
	  this thing.
	  </li>


          <li><p>There is an API for querying, creating snapshots, using
          annotations.
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>Handling Errors.  Allows best effort approach.
	  </p></li>


	</ul>


<p>Great example: Lance Armstrong Tour de France victories.  Question:
How many Tour de France victories does he have?  The answer depends on
  when you ask the question.</p>

<p>Be very careful what your events look like.  It's very hard to modify
  them.</p>

<p>Non event sources of data.  When the intent of the user is not clear
  from the datasource.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Other Sessions of Note:</p>

<p>Mon: 17:30 CON7474 ES, Distributed Systems, and CQRS with Java EE.</p>

<p>Tue: 13:15 CON4083 Async by Default, Synchronous when Necessary</p>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON7615&showEnrolled=false">Secrets of Rock Star Developers (and How to Become One!) [CON7615]</a></h4>

<p>I was invited to co-present at this session by my good
friend <a href="https://code4.life/">Bruno Souza</a> regarding some
lessons in my book <a href="http://ridingthecrest.com/">Secrets of the
Rock Star Developers</a>.  Bruno also invited Yuji Kubota, a developer
from NTT in Japan.  Yuji shared his experiences in achieving developer
  proficiency in spite of his complete hearing impairment.</p>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON7624&showEnrolled=false">Powerful Lessons from Top Java EE Experts [CON7624]
</a></h4>

<p>I was invited to participate in this panel discussion
by <a href="http://eldermoraes.com/">Elder Moraes</a>, who is now
working for Oracle to continue to advance Java EE 8 in the community in
Brazil.  I was a bit skeptical about the prospects of this panel because
Elder had invited fourteen (14!) people to be panelists.  Perhaps he did
  not expect us all to show up, but 13 of us did.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/20171001-con7615.jpg" alt="Image of panelists" /></p>

<p>My records show Elder, Adam Bien, Bruno Souza, David Heffelfinger,
Edson Yanaga, Ivar Grimstad, Steve Millidge, Kevin Sutter, Reza Rahman,
and Ruslan Synytsky</p>

<p>With that large number of people, and only an hour, it was a wonder
we were coherent at all, but I guess it speaks to the quality of the
Java EE community's ability to collaborate that we had a productive and
informative session.  Of course, the big news was the decision by Oracle
to invest in handing off the IP of its Java EE JSRs, as of version Java
EE 8, to the Eclipse Foundation to be the basis of a new top level
project
there: <a href="https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j">EE4J</a>.</p>

<h3>Monday</h3>

<p>I started the day off with booth duty.  This year, the conference was
back at Moscone, but at Moscone West.  The exhibit area was much larger
than the hotel space at the Hilton Union Square from previous years.  My
booth demo was a part of the new Serverless Fn project booth, but it was
only runnable when I was in the booth, as it was a last minute
  addition.</p>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON2022&showEnrolled=false">Servlet 4.0: A New Twist on an Old Favorite [CON2022]
</a></h4>

<p>This was one of my three conference sessions I had the opportunity to
present.  The slides are in the content catalog at the previous
link, and the video
is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4tSKHH63fE">at YouTube</a>.
With the announcement of EE4J, Oracle is getting out of the business of
leading Java EE specs, so this was very likely the last time I presented
about Servlet at JavaOne.  You never know what the future holds, but I
approached it that way and gave it my all.  I hope that comes across in
  the video.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/keynotes.html#monday">Java Keynote</a></h4>

<p>This was the big one.  The full video is
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg9lmk60sg">YouTube</a>.
  Big announcements included:</p>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>EE4J
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>Debut of the <a href="https://fnproject.io">Fn Project</a>
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>Demonstration of Project Jafar, Cloud Performance
          Tuning and flight recorder
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Demonstration
	  of <a href="http://www.wercker.com/java">Oracle Wercker</a>
	  cloud container native development pipeline system.  Wercker
	  allows you to build, deploy, and operate Kubernetes based
	  containerized cloud applications.
	  </p></li>
          
	  <li><p>Java SE 9 final release overview
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>Announcement of new release model for Java: every 6th
	  months.  This brought along with it a new naming scheme: YY.M.
	  That means the next release is 18.3.
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>There was also an interesting keynote from Intel VP of
          System Technologies Michael Green.  Mr. Green's keynote starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg9lmk60sg#t=34m59s">34:59</a>
	  </p></li>

          <li><p>There were some nifty demos at the beginning of the
          keynote.
	  </p></li>

	</ul>

        <h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON3920&showEnrolled=false">Building a Serverless State Service for the Cloud with Java 9 [CON3920]</a></h4>

<p>This session is the one I was most excited to give, because it is the
future for me at Oracle.  After being allowed to finish Java EE 8
(thanks in no small part to the community and Oracle's attentiveness to
it), I was given the opportunity to join the team responsible
for <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/coherence/overview/">Oracle
Coherence</a>.  This team is building a new state service for the cloud,
based on Coherence, but with a much simpler API.  In fact, you can think
of it as an API-less service since it will be exposed with cloud enabled
implementations of existing Java 8 collections data structures, with
some additions for things not present in the case of an entirely local
collection.  Unfortunately, this talk was not recorded, but the slides
  are available in the content catalog link above.</p>

<h3>Tuesday</h3>

<p>I did another spell of booth duty in the morning, as well as a panel
discussion on the DevLive stage with Heather Vancura, Antoine-Sabot
Durand, and Linda DeMichiel.  The interview is
  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTaBUu6C47U">YouTube</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=IGN7979&showEnrolled=false">Ignite Session [IGN7979]: Java Your Next Theremin, among other talks</a></h4>

<p>Kevin Nilson, leader of the Silicon Valley JUG and wonderful guy
organized an "Ignite Session" again.  I'd never done one before, but
after the one I attended at DevoxxUS in April I felt I could do it.  The
idea with an Ignite session is you get 5 minutes to present your talk.
In that five minutes you get 20 slides, each advancing every 15 seconds,
on auto-advance.  I gave a talk
about <a href="https://static.rainfocus.com/oracle/oow17/sess/1504978192376001CTLb/PF/20171003-javaone-lightning-theremin_1507731853795001sVbN.pptx">building

<h3>Wednesday</h3>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON2023&showEnrolled=false">Contemporary Java Web Applications with JSF 2.3 [CON2023]</a></h4>

<p>This was the most monentous talk for me personally.  Fifteen years,
six months, and seven days after giving my first JavaOne talk about JSF
I gave what is likely to be my last, for the same reason as with
Servlet.  But don't dismay, the future is bright for JSF.  JSF is in the
first batch of projects to be handed off to EE4J, and it will very
  likely be taken forward by JSF community expert Arjan Tijms.</p>

<p>Slides are above and video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yshXLB_HdhU">on YouTube</a>.</p>

<h3>Thursday</h3>

<p>Not having to deliver any sessions, speak to any customers, do any
booth duty, or sit-in for any guest spots, I was able to attend sessions
  today.</p>

<h4><a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/keynotes.html#thursday">Java Community Keynote</a></h4>

<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON1706&showEnrolled=false">Services, Assemble! Apply MVP Principles to Create Microservices Without Chaos [CON1706]</a></h4>

<p>This talk by my friend Mark Heckler talked about how to apply MVP
  (Minimum Viable Product) principles to create cutting-edge
  Microservices without chaos with Spring Cloud/Netflix OSS</p>

<p>Here are my raw notes.</p>

	<ul>

<p>@MkHeck</p>

<p>Glad you're here to the end.</p>

<p>Listed some Pivotal products: Spring.</p>

<p>Who am I silde.</p>

<p>Likes Microservices, becuse it addresses many of the problems of the
  Monoliths.</p>
<p>Analogy of Microservices to the Avengers.  Together they are more
than the sum of the parts.  They come together to form a resilient
  system.</p>

<p>Enablers: Monoliths are simpler from the outside.  Microservices
introduces a lot of complexity.  Enablers: Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
Spring Boot is your onramp in becoming productive in the cloud.  Any
  place you can deploy a JVM, you can deploy Spring Boot.</p>

<p>Spring Cloud OSS</p>

<p>Operational: config, service registry, circuit breaker, load
balancer, intelligent router, asyc messaging, distributed tracing,
security/oauth.</p>

<p>Impl: Spring Cloud Config, Netflix Eureaka, Netflix Hystrix, Netflix
Ribbon, Netflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Spring
  Cloud Security</p>

<p>With a good circuit breaker, you can nest them.</p>

<p>Demo: start.spring.io.  Lots of extolling the virtues of this web
  app.</p>


<p>application.properties, renamed to bootstrap.properties</p>

<p>Pointed out 80/20 rule.</p>

<p>Zuul plays a role of deompising a monolith.</p>

</ul>


<h4><a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=CON1439&showEnrolled=false">Container: Check! But What About Persistent Data, Big Data, and Fast Data?! [CON1439]</a></h4>

<p>This session, by two of the engineers behind Mesosphere and Apache
Mesos, used the 16 bit video game "The Secret of Monkey Island" to
explore the challenges in running stateless services at scale in the
  real world that has state.  Here are my raw notes.</p>

	<ul>

<p>Joerg Schad and Johaness Unterstein</p>

<p>Monkey Island theme.</p>

<p>It all began with a monolith</p>

<p>Hardware, OS, app</p>

<p>Hardware, OS, web app</p>

<p>add horizontal scaling: Hardware, OS, app</p>

<p>add services under web app.</p>

<p>Add VMs under OS, and IaaS underVMs</p>

<p>Replace web app with finer services: Microservices.  Predefined
  interfaces where each is defined to do one thing pretty good.</p>

<p>Add containers on top of OS: Put more services on each OS
node. Spreadsheet scheduling.</p>

<p>Container scheduling comes into play.  Resource management.</p>

<p>Service management: collections of containers.  Excellent pictures of
  containers from container ships sitting in row boats.</p>

<p>Health and readiness checks.  Health check, "I am ready to serve
  traffic".</p>

<p>But how do we get containers into production</p>

<p>DC/OS maven plugin: mvn docker:build docker:push dcos:deploy</p>

<p>Or mvn package dcos:uploadArtifact dcos:deployUCR</p>

<p>MapReduce is crunching Data</p>

<p>Data Processing: SMACK stack.  1. Events 2. Ingest (Kafka) 3. Store
  (Cassandra) 4. Analyze (Spark) 5. Act (Akka)</p>

<p>Demo of running DC/OS on AWS.  </p>

	</ul>

<p>The last session of the show, for me, and for many folks, was given
by my fripnd and
fellow <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nullpointersband/">NullPointer</a>
Ken Koussen.  Ken is an excellent instructor and is so good at
explaining complex topics.  Ken has a new book of the same name as this
talk, and he was kind enough to sport me a copy in exchange for a meal
at
cash-only <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/tommys-joynt-san-francisco">Tommy's
Joynt</a>.</p>

<p>Here are my raw notes.</p>

<ul>

  <p>Ken Koussen</p>

<p>A few slides of self promition.</p>

<p>github.com/koussen/java_8_recipes</p>

<p>github.com/koussen/java_9_recipes</p>

<p>The Basics</p>

<p>streams, lambdas, method references</p>

<p>Beyond the basics</p>

<p>Lazy Streams</p>

<p>The peek method</p>

<p>Strings as Streams</p>

<p>anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch</p>

<p>collect and reduce</p>

<p>flatMap vs. Map</p>

<p>Optional</p>

<hr />

<p>Functional interfaces</p>

<p>taken as given</p>

<p>Steam produces sequence of elements.  Does not store them.  Does not
  modify them.  Produces new items.  Operations lazy when possible.
  Once you hit a terminal, that stream is done.</p>

<p>If you use a stream in a method, it should be created in that method.</p>

<p>operations from source to pipeline.  No items are pulled from source
  until terminal operation is reached.</p>

<p>Shows the lazyness.  findFirst() is a short circuiting terminal
  operations.</p>

<p>Debugging with the peek() method.  IntelliJ has a nice plugin called
  StreamDebugger.</p>

<p>peek() is like .map(n -> { sop(n.entry); } );</p>

<p>Strings as Streams</p>

<p>aside: of() method.</p>

<p>Workaround.  chars() and codePoints() on String.</p>

<p>codePoints() returns a stream.  </p>

<code><pre>
    s.toLowerCase().codePoints().filter().collect(appendCodePoint).toString()
</pre></code>

<p>Three argument Collect.</p>

</ul>

<p>I was literally the last person to leave the conference baggage area,
as shown in this pic of my lone bag with a member of the Marriott Hotel
  Staff.</p>
