<p>I still recommend JSF 2.3 EG member and major Mojarra
committer <a href="http://arjan-tijms.omnifaces.org/p/jsf-23.html">Arjan
Tijms'</a> blog post for a feature overview of JSF 2.3, but this post
gives a brief look into a feature I consider a key validation of the two
Java EE 8 specs to which I contribute: Servlet 4.0 and JSF 2.3.  The
feature is HTTP/2 Server Push, and it's the biggest new feature in
Servlet 4.0 in terms of API impact.  This blog post shows how Mojarra
2.3.1-SNAPSHOT uses Servlet 4.0 Server Push and solicits testing of this
feature for eventual inclusion in Mojarra 2.3.1, and hopefully into
  GlassFish 5.0.</p>

<h2>The Origin of the Feature</h2>

<p>Way back at
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZR-HRP7HtI">beginning of
Servlet 4.0</a> in July 2014, when HTTP/2 itself was not even yet final,
the idea of using Server Push for JSF was already apparent.  After all,
the whole point of the feature, from the HTTP/2 protocol level, is to
increase the perceived performance of web pages by allowing the server
to start sending the assets of the web page before the browser has even
started parsing the web page to discover what assets it needs.  (I like
to call this
the <a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/6#48006008">Matthew
6:8</a> feature of HTTP/2.)  Web Frameworks such as JSF are in a great
position to automatically leverage this feature because the act of
authoring the application causes the page author to explicitly indicate
at runtime which assets go with which pages.  In other words, JSF users
get this feature for free without having to change their app in the
  least.</p>

<h2>The Specification of the Feature</h2>

<p>The Servlet Expert Group, in particular Greg Wilkins, has crafted an
easy-to-use way to take advantage of Server Push: simply ask the
current <code>HttpServletRequest</code> for
a <code>newPushBuilder</code>, manipulate
the <a href="https://maven.java.net/service/local/repositories/releases/archive/javax/servlet/javax.servlet-api/4.0.0-b05/javax.servlet-api-4.0.0-b05-javadoc.jar/!/javax/servlet/http/PushBuilder.html">PushBuilder</a>
API as desired, and then call <code>push()</code> to initiate sending
  the bytes of the resource to the client.</p>

<p>From the JSF side, the use of the feature is not captured in the
JavaDoc.  Rather, it is in the spec PDF section 2.2.6.  This section is
a high level overview of what happens in the Render Response phase of
the request processing lifecycle.  We intentionally left the push
requirements very high level to allow maximum latitude in
implementation.  We also had to specify it well in advance of Servlet
4.0 going final due to scheduling constraints with finishing JSF
  2.3.</p>

<h2>The Implementation of the Feature</h2>

<p>I am very thankful to my co-spec
lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shingwaichan/">Dr. Shing Wai
Chan</a> for implementing the GlassFish side of this feature,
and <a href="http://www.notshabby.net/">Ryan Lubke</a> for implementing
the underlying Grizzly support for HTTP/2, including push.  Ryan had to
do several last minute tweaks to get the implementation this far, and
  it's not 100% done yet.  That's why I'm hoping you'll try it.</p>

<p>On the JSF side, I modified the implementation
of <code>ExternalContext.encodeResourceURL()</code> to push the resource
using the <code>PushBuilder</code> API.  Because our tests run Mojarra
against both GlassFish 4.1.1 and GlassFish 5.0 trunk, I had to code it
such that the feature only kicks in if Servlet 4.0 is actually
  available.</p>

<h2>Testing the Feature</h2>

<p>To test the feature, you must first make sure you are using exactly
JDK 1.8.0_121, no more no less.  The reason for this precise requirement
is explained in this
email <a href="https://java.net/projects/servlet-spec/lists/jsr369-experts/archive/2017-04/message/43">to
the Servlet EG</a>.  Then, download the GlassFish nightly from
&lt;<a href="http://download.oracle.com/glassfish/5.0/nightly/">http://download.oracle.com/glassfish/5.0/nightly/</a>&gt;
(from 2017-04-17 or later) and replace the <code>javax.faces.jar</code>
in the <code>modules</code> directory
with <a href="https://maven.java.net/service/local/repositories/snapshots/content/org/glassfish/javax.faces/2.3.1-SNAPSHOT/javax.faces-2.3.1-20170417.161359-6.jar"><code>org.glassfish:javax.faces:2.3.1-SNAPSHOT</code></a>
(or later).</p>

<p>Once your GlassFish has been patched to have the latest Mojarra,
deploy an app that has lots of resources.  I suggest
the <a href="http://repository.primefaces.org/org/primefaces/showcase/6.0/showcase-6.0.war">PrimeFaces
6.0 showcase</a>.  Once deployed the easiest way to see HTTP/2 in action
is to use Chrome with Developer Tools to hit
&lt;https://localhost:8181/showcase-6.0/index.xhtml&gt; Note that you
have to jump through some extra hoops because Chrome finds it easiest to
  only support HTTP/2 over TLS.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/20170418-chrome-https-localhost-02.png" alt="Image of Chrome Your connection is not private warning" /></p>

<p>Once the PrimeFaces is being served over HTTPS to Chrome from your
patched GlassFish 5.0, you can visit the "Compare" widget within the
"Multimedia" section.  In another Chrome tab, open up
&lt;chrome://net-internals/#events&q=type:HTTP2_SESSION&gt;.  Find the
lowest <code>HTTP2_SESSION</code> item to localhost:8181 in the list and
check the checkbox.  Do a find in page for <code>lara-ps3</code>.  You
  can see that this image was pushed with server push, as shown next.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/assets/20170418-net-internals-push.png"><img width="1024" height="200" src="/blog/assets/20170418-net-internals-push.png" alt="Image of Chrome Your connection is not private warning" /></a></p>

<p>You can use find in page to look for other hits
on <code>HTTP2_SESSION_RECV_PUSH_PROMISE</code> to see resources being
  pushed.</p>

<p>Clicking over to View-&gt;Developer-&gt;Developer Tools, click the
"Disable cache" checkbox and reload the page.  Look at the Waterfall
column ta see the impact that push has on page load times.  You can see
that some of the resources are being delivered before the page even
finishes loading.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/assets/20170418-devtools-push.png"><img width="1024" height="273" src="/blog/assets/20170418-devtools-push.png" alt="Image of Chrome Your connection is not private warning" /></a></p>


<p>It is beyond the scope of this article to explore this vital aspect
of push, but I hope someone else will do so.  After all, what's the
point of the
feature <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales">if
it does not make page load times seem faster</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

This feature is still in SNAPSHOT form.  I need testing to verify it
works for some more cases.  If it causes any trouble at all, we may have
to put it behind a <code>com.sun.faces context-param</code>.  Please
leave comments here with your findings.
