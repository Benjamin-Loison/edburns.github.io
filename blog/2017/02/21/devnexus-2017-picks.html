    <p>Edited: 2017-02-23: Recommend additional session.</p>

<p>I am blessed with the opportunity to speak
at <a href="http://devnexus.com/">DevNexus</a> again this year, after
having spoken there
in <a href="http://purl.oclc.org/NET/edburns/speaking-engagements/">in
2014 and 2015</a>.  Pratik, Vincent, Gunnar and the
whole <a href="http://www.ajug.org/">Atlanta JUG</a> do a great job
putting on this very community focused show.  It is the largest
developer event in the southeastern U.S., an area of the country that
vitally needs more such events.  There are so many great session from so
many great speakers, though.  You really can't go wrong with any path.
Here are my picks for sessions I plan to attend.</p>

<h3>Wednesday &mdash; Workshop Day</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li><p><a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/15529">Building Reactive Applications</a></p>

  <p>A full day workshop with the legendary Venkat Subramaniam?  Yes
  please.  Venkat's presentation skills are legendary and his humble
  delivery creates a learning environment that is sure to enrich your
  career.  It's probably booked out, though it doesn't say so on the
  conference site.</p>

  </li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Thursday &mdash; Conference Day One</h3>

	<ul>

	  <li><p>09:15 Sidney Marcus Auditorium <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/19975">Don't
	        walk away from Complexity, Run (Keynote)</a></p>

            <p>Sticking with the Venkat theme, this is the keynote, so
            obviously I'll be attending.  The theme of "complexity as
            bugbear" is an old saw, but Venkat is sure to offer a fresh
            take on it.</p>
            
	  </li>

	  <li><p>10:30 A302 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17348">Building a private CI/CD pipeline with Java and Docker in the Cloud</a>
	    </p>

            <p>In the spirit of DevOps, we all need to try to be as full
            stack as
            possible.  <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaruch">Baruch
            Sadogursky</a> knows his stuff, in this space in
            particular.  We use Artifactory at Oracle.  The 75 minute
            length of the DevNexus session should allow him to stretch
            out and really teach some skills.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>13:00 A316 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17137">Tuning with Poor Tools and Cheap Drink</a>
	    </p>

          <p>Kirk is one of the leading experts in the world on Java
          performance tuning.  We are lucky to have him at DevNexus.</p>

          </li>
          
          <li><p>14:30 A411 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17426">Reactive Thinking in Java</a>
	    </p>

            <p>Yakov Fain is a provocative and thoughtful speaker, I
            look forward to his thoughts on this hot topic.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>16:00 My session is in the next slot, in room A311, but if I
	  wasn't speaking then, I'd go
	  see <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/19469">The
	  Art of Java Performance</a>
	  from <a href="https://twitter.com/JoroRoss">Jonathan Ross</a>.
	  </p></li>
          
	  <li><p>17:30
	  A302 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17356">Docker
	        tips and tricks for Java Developers</a></p>

            <p>Docker is a big enough of a pain in the rear to make a
            "tips and tricks" session well worthwhile.  I haven't seen a
            talk from Mr. Tsang before, but his credentials speak for
            themselves.  Also, it may be nice to find kindred spirits
            who are also leverage Docker and smooth out its sharp
            edges.</p>


          </li>

          </ul>

        <h3>Friday &mdash; Conference Day Two</h3>

        <ul>

	  <li><p>10:30 A412 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17302">Why does Yesterday's Best Practice Become Tomorrow's Antipattern?</a>
	    </p>


            <p>Neal Ford is another conference legend and former
            moderator of the <a href="/blog/2014/06/22/web-framework-smackdown-2014-edition.html">2014 edition of the web
            framework smackdown</a>.  As an author whose best practices
            have been labeled as anti-patterns, some of which by
            Mr. Ford himself, I look forward to his answer.</p>

          </li>


	  <li><p>13:00
	  A403 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17318">Introduction
	        to Apache Kafka - The Next Gen Event Streaming System </a></p>

            <p>James is an excellent and engaging speaker.  He's managed
            to become an expert on a wide range of highly relevant
            technologies over the years, no mean feat in itself.  Let's
            see what he has to say about the latest hotness.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>14:30 A411 <a href="https://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/15655">Java, JCP, Adopt-a-JSR & You - A Winning Combination</a></p>

            <p>The Java Community Process is the driving force for the
            evolution and vitality of the Java ecosystem.  This session
            will show you how to get involved in making the future
            Java.</p>

            <p>14:30
          A305 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17309">Successful
                JavaEE DevOps In The Cloud</a></p>

            <p>This ambitious session features
            a <a href="http://devnexus.illinoisjug.org/">pre-configured
            VM</a> and will show you how to use it.  I've given this
            sort of session many times before and it's hard to pull
            off.  I like the topic and I want to see how they do it.</p>

          </li>

	  <li><p>16:00 A405 <a href="http://devnexus.com/s/devnexus2017/presentations/17164">MVC
	        1.0 - Now Even Better!</a></p>

            <p>Oracle's decision to drop MVC from the Java EE 8
            specification was met with grumbles by some and cheers by
            others.  I look forward to seeing what the new spec lead
            has to say about it.</p>

          </li>
