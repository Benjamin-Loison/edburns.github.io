    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><h1>JavaLand 2015 Wrap Up</h1><p>After
 months of preparation, it all came down to three days of intense 
execution, and I was just one speaker. I can only marvel at the 
logistical acumen that was on display from the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/team/" rel="nofollow">JavaLand</a> and DOAG team. I had an action , capably coodinated by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/personenseiten/andreas-badelt/" rel="nofollow">Andreas Badelt</a>.
 Because of the high level of activity on my personal agenda, I was not 
able to attend as many sessions as I would have liked. In any case, this
 blog entry is my place to share my overall impressions of the 
conference, and of the sessions I did get a chance to attend.</p><h3>Day One</h3><p><a href="https://community.oracle.com/blog/20150324-lagergren-keynote-hassle.png"><img __embedded_id="401" src="20150330_files/20150324-lagergren-keynote-hassle.html" style="float: right;" width="200" height="148"></a> Right off the bat, I want to tip my cap to <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/lagergren" rel="nofollow">Marcus Lagergren</a>
 for remaining calm in the face of some AV problems. Even with all that,
 and the 45 minute session duration, Marcus managed to give a compelling
 whirlwind tour of his personal experience with Java from the beginning.
 More photos like the one on the right are available from <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/hildebrandttk" rel="nofollow">Stefan Hildebrandt</a>'s <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/130465085@N06/sets/72157651139135557/" rel="nofollow">flickr photo stream</a>.
 I think there is a lot more room in the "20 year's of Java meme", 
however, and I applaud Marcus for wisely not attempting to speak for all
 of it and drawing from his own experiences. That's one great thing 
about the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23java20&amp;src=typd&amp;customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">#java20</a> meme, everyone has their own story. Maybe at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/call-for-proposals.html" rel="nofollow">JavaOne 2015</a> they will have some sort of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://storycorps.org/" rel="nofollow">Story Corps</a>
 type thing where people can give their stories. Come to think of it, if
 someone wants to build Story Corps as a Service (SCAAS), perpahs they 
can sell it to Oracle for use at the show.</p><p>Shortly after Marcus's session, I presented with my good friend <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/SourceKnights" rel="nofollow">Oliver Szymanzki</a> a 45 minute capsule of our full day training session about <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/java-ee-7-from-an-html5-perspective-javaland-2015" rel="nofollow">Java EE 7 from an HTML5 Perspective</a>.
 It was tough to make a meaningful abstraction from a full day session 
to just 45 minutes, but I hope at least people could take something 
useful away from it.</p><p>Then came my first exposure to the EAA, which was my only chance to present JSF content here at JavaLand. I gave a <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/jsf-22-input-output-javaland-2015" rel="nofollow">quick presentation</a>
 and had an informal meeting with several JSF EG members who were at 
JavaLand. We covered f:socket, multi-component validation, and URL 
mapping.</p><p>The evening community event was really not to be missed. 
If you ever have a chance to attend JavaLand, I really recommend you 
participate.</p><h3>Day Two</h3><p>I started out the day by presenting a modified version of my <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/http2-comes-to-java-what-servlet-40-means-to-you-devnexus-2015" rel="nofollow">DevNexus session about Servlet 4.0 and HTTP/2</a>. I basically dropped the demo and moved the Java SE 9 content to an EAA session in order to fit into the 45 minute window.</p><p>Following my session I was able to enjoy <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/nmcl" rel="nofollow">Mark Little's</a> keynote about Java <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.doag.org/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=483801&amp;locS=0&amp;vid=491907" rel="nofollow">Enterprise and Internet of Things</a>.
 This session put out some hard-won truths of problems we have solved in
 Java as cautionary tales for newer stacks that seem intent on 
re-inventing wheels rather than standing on the shoulders of others. I 
must admit it was a feel-good session, but still realistic and largely <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid" rel="nofollow">kool aid free</a>.</p><p>In the afternoon, I supported <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/dblevins" rel="nofollow">David Blevins</a> during his <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://www.doag.org/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=483801&amp;locS=0&amp;vid=491386" rel="nofollow">session about the new Security JSR</a>. This was a very informative session that got a whole lot done in only 45 minutes. I hope it encouraged some people to <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375" rel="nofollow">get involved in JSR-375</a>.</p><p>Running back to the EAA, I presented the exciting work being done by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/OpenJDK" rel="nofollow">Michael McMahon</a>
 to bring a new Http Client to Java SE 9, including HTTP/2 support. I 
can't post the slides, but I'm sure we'll have something on this at 
JavaOne.</p><p>My last engagment of the conference proper was to participate in a joint vJUG/NightHacking session regarding <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://nighthacking.com/adopt-a-jsr-nighthackingvjug-sessions/" rel="nofollow">Adopt-a-JSR</a>. This was lots of fun, and I thank <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/steveonjava" rel="nofollow">Stephen Chin</a> and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/sjmaple" rel="nofollow">Simon Maple</a> for providing a vehicle for it.</p><p>As
 a nice wind-down from the conference, and a bit of chill before the 
training day, I was invited by DOAG boss Fried Saacke to attend the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/dasniko/status/580831517418618883" rel="nofollow">5 year celebration dinner</a> for <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.ijug.eu/java-aktuell/das-magazin.html" rel="nofollow">Java Aktuell</a>
 magazine. I didn't know it at the time, but the invitation included an 
opportunity to give a short speech, in German, on the importance of JCP 
to the Java Community. I hope I didn't mangle my words too badly.</p><p><a href="https://community.oracle.com/blog/20150326-tastykakes-and-usb.jpeg"><img __embedded_id="402" src="20150330_files/20150326-tastykakes-and-usb.html" style="float: left;" width="200" height="150"></a>
 After being blessed with many years of German conference opportunities 
at which I invariably bring home lots of chocolate, I felt it was time 
to give the Germans a taste of American-style sweets along with their 
pre-loaded VM usb sticks. These Tasty Kakes or a specialty of my 
home-town of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.tastykake.com/history" rel="nofollow">Philadelphia</a>, and each attendee of the session <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/programm/vertiefe-schulungstag/" rel="nofollow">Java EE aus einer HTML5-Perspektive</a> received some along with a full day of instruction and a USB stick with a VM containing the workshop materials.</p><p>In summary, JavaLand has lots to recommend it. Come for the content, stay for the fun.</p></div>
