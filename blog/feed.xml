Thanks for commenting!&amp;nbsp; I'd love to know how you were alerted of 
the existence of this post.&amp;nbsp; I'm quite certain that you don't 
manually subscribe to my blog entry, because, after all, you wrote the 
camel book.

You don't by any chance remember that session at SGI in Mountain View in
 1995, do you?

Yes, I have custom RSS feeds that watch for my name and the names of my 
books and FLOSS Weekly using the power of Google, which I read in Google
 Reader.

I taught a lot at SGI during the first web boom, so I don't remember the
 *specific* session, but I remember being there. Oddly enough, my 
&quot;Google Tech Talk&quot; on git was done about 50 feet from where I used to 
teach at SGI, since Google HQ is the former SGI buildings.

Having &quot;more that one way to do it&quot; gives the system an inherent 
advantage, perhaps one of the reasons for the longevity of PERL.

If product A provides &quot;only one way to do it&quot;,&amp;nbsp; it can become 
inherently harder to integrate A&amp;nbsp; to work with C and D.

If B on the other hand is flexible, there's a good chance I can work 
around any issues,
at least I have more options and tactics available to succeed getting 
the whole system up and running.
So I'll choose B over A any day.&amp;nbsp; It's genetically stronger.

This is perhaps one of the problematic consequences of&amp;nbsp; 
&quot;programming by convention&quot;&amp;nbsp; that is often overlooked.
It might get you up-and-running with something impressive to show quite 
early on, but try and do anything that
conflicts with those conventions and by golly you're in for a hard time!

Convention is not mutually exclusive with configuration, you can have the best of both worlds.

If you think about what you're trying to do with JSF, it's putting things on a page in the right place
doing the right things. And it's very hard to do. To be successful you need to make it really easy.
Do you want JSF to be exclusive to only the top level of software engineers in the world? sounds
interesting but does not work. The biggest mistake was terminating VWP. If there was a visual
project it would end up driving the underlying implementation. I think it unlikely that it would be
possible to create a VWP implementation given the complexities of the product as it exists today.

If JSF is to be a world beater it has to be really easy to use, and it isn't at present.

Another, issue I have is that I'd like to see some de-coupling from CSS. The component libs are
doing some skinning but CSS is a complete nightmare really. Leave it for the .1% who need it.

To address your point, sure, you sometimes need to delve in and do some special things, but
how many tiers of complexity do you want? I want &quot;really simple&quot; and &quot;potentially quite complex&quot;.
I want to use the latter very rarely.

Brendan.

 Yes this action is long overdue, and many open source projects have 
long been more open than JSF is, even after considering the changes 
announced in this blog entry. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://weblogs.java.net%20]]%3E%3C%21[CDATA[%20/blog/edburns/archive/2004/06/welcome_to_the.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;very first blog post on java.net&lt;/a&gt;,
 nearly six years ago, advertised the availability of Sun’s JSF 
implementation under an open development model. This was followed one 
year later by an announcment of &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2005/06/javaserver_face_2.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the Java Distribution License for JSF&lt;/a&gt;,
 and another year later with the release of all of Java SE and EE under 
GPL. All of those announcements had to do with code being free. The 
process of &lt;em&gt;designing&lt;/em&gt; the code is another matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JSF is designed using the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://jcp.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Java Community Process&lt;/a&gt;.
 JCP allows the individuals who lead the specification teams great 
latitude in determining just how open they want their process to be. 
100% openness is strongly encouraged, but not required. As mentioned in &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cayhorstmann/archive/2009/01/a_call_to_fix_t.html#comments&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;the discussion&lt;/a&gt; on Cay Horstman’s blog entry: “&lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://weblogs.java.net/blog/cayhorstmann/archive/2009/01/a_call_to_fix_t.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;A Call to Fix the JCP Oberver Status&lt;/a&gt;”, JAX-RS (&lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://jsr311.dev.java.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JSR-311&lt;/a&gt;) is a great example of a very open process. Another great example is Mike Milikich's Mobile Information Device Profile (&lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://opensource.motorola.com/sf/projects/jsr271&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JSR-271&lt;/a&gt;).
 At the other end of the spectrum, we have many more JSRs that are not 
very open at all. I don't want to name names, but you know who you are. 
JSF is somewhere in the middle, though I like to think we’re tending 
towards more open. As Cay mentions, our &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;issue tracker of record&lt;/a&gt; is public. As I mentioned above, Sun’s JSF implementation is an &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;an open source project&lt;/a&gt;. But as Cay also says, we need to do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cay calls for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;background-color: #efefef;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email and forum discussions are to be archived (unless there is some specific reason for confidentiality)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All versions of spec drafts are to be archived&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observers have access to these archives&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I”m

never” department, I have to point out that we're almost done with JSF 
2.0! When you tune into the discussion, you’ll see that we're nearly 
ready to hand our Proposed Final Draft off to the JCP. I just posted an 
    Editor's draft tonight and you can find it &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/files/documents/1936/128586/jsf-spec-2.0-20090304.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;as a zip file&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://javaserverfaces-spec-public.dev.java.net/nonav/snapshots/jsf-spec-2.0-20090304/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;as a web browsable document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;technoratitag&quot;&gt; Technorati Tags: &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;edburns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I'm expert member on some JSRs (includin Java EE 6) and I find 
frustrating not to be able to observe other JSRs (some even being part 
of Java EE6). Last december at Devoxx I talked with JCP's representative
 and asked them, at least, to allow people to observe any JSR. I posted 
an entry on my blog about this topic :

Antonio--I read your blog. I have no problem limiting email privileges 
to the actual experts, but the public should be able to observe the 
discussion. I don't know if that's how Ed has set it up. As Ed noted, 
JSF 2.0 is nearly done, so this is mainly a model for the future.

 last had the pleasure of visiting the lovely Baltic city of Tallinn in 
2012, when I presented JSF 2.2 and the Rockstar talk at GeekOut 2012. 
Now that I've got something new (for me anyway) to talk about I made the
 cut and was invited back to present Servlet 4.0 at &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://2015.geekout.ee/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;GeekOut 2015&lt;/a&gt;.
 Attendence was capped at 400, giving this conference a very exclusive 
feel. Indeed, 99% of those that registered for the conference actually 
did attend. This was the 5th installment of the GeekOut conference, 
hosted by &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://zeroturnaround.com/software/xrebel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ZeroTurnaround&lt;/a&gt;.
 This was the first time the conference had two tracks, so my report 
here only covers the sessions I actually attended. All of the sessions 
were video recorded, and I expect the sessions will be made available 
soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Day One&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day one started with back-to-back plenary sessions offering two different perspectives on the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23java20&amp;amp;src=typd&amp;amp;customTheme=otn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;#java20&lt;/a&gt; theme. &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/steveonjava&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt;
 gave a historically rich but technically light session featuring lots 
of freshly recorded video clips with Java luminaries. Of course there 
was ample content from James Gosling, who I would like to congratulate 
for winning the 2015 &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ieee.org/about/awards/bios/vonneumann_recipients.html#sect1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IEEE John von Neumann Medal&lt;/a&gt;.
 This puts James in the company of such titans as Leslie Lamport, Donald
 Knuth, Ivan Sutherland, and Fred Brooks. I was happy to see that 
Stephen dove deeper and offered the perspectives of John Rose and 
Georges Saab on more fundamental aspects of the history of Java. &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mjpt777&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Martin Thompson&lt;/a&gt;
 followed Steven with a very complimentary session. The session was so 
complimentary I'd almost say they coordinated. Martin's session gave his
 personal perspective on Java over the years, with some very interesting
 stories from his work on making Java perform well. I liked his 
perspective on the causes and challenges of bloat in a long-lived 
software ecosystem. Another very interesting perspective was the extent 
to which high frequency trading drives advances in performance (in Java 
and in the entire industry). Martin's talk piqued my desire for a 
#java20 talk about all the companies that have been spawned directly or 
indirectly by the Java ecosystem. I'm thinking Interface21, Tangosol, 
JBoss, NoFluffJustStuff, ZeroTurnaround, Atlassian, Parleys and there 
are many others. Hey, I'm pretty sure there's an interesting talk in 
there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the plenary sessions, we broke out into the
 two tracks, starting with my session on Servlet 4.0 and a session on 
Cassandra. My session was quite well attended, and it went pretty 
smoothly. We'll see how the feedback shows up, however! After my 
session, I went down to see &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/myfear&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Markus Eisele&lt;/a&gt;
 talk about Apache Camel. I hadn't followed the progress in the Camel 
community and I'm happy to see it is doing well since. Also nice to see 
my old pal &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ghohpe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gregor Hohpe&lt;/a&gt; represented virtually, as his book is represented in spirit in Camel itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was very keen to see the Vaadin talk from &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/peter_lehto&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Peter Lehto&lt;/a&gt;.
 I had long been perplexed at Vaadin's ability to decouple itself from 
GWT, particularly as GWT's popularity has dwindled. This talk, at last, 
promised to lay bare the secret at the heart of Vaadin: its runtime is 
dependent on GWT. I was not disappointed, but I was also very pleasantly
 surprised. Mr. Lehto directly addressed the question of the relevance 
of server side UI frameworks, including Vaadin (and JSF, though he 
didn't name it specifically) in an HTML5 JavaScript framework world. He 
did so by pointing out the importance of abstraction, which I've long 
been pointing out when presenting on JSF. In the case of Vaadin and JSF,
 their core value add is the authoring experience. With Vaadin, it's 
Java programmers who want to treat the world like Swing. With JSF it's 
&quot;page developers&quot; who want to treat the world like some form of 
VisualBasic environment. For Vaadin, its existing abstraction allows 
their underlying runtime to leverage W3C Web Components (or the polymer 
implementation of the same) for some Vaadin components while relying on 
GWT for others. Peter put a strong stake in the ground and predicted 
that W3C Web Components are the future for web development. I don't 
disagree, but JSF is well positioned to leverage W3C Web Components 
because it fits in nicely with the JSF abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Day Two&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day two started out with &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/asz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Attila Szegedi's&lt;/a&gt;
 highly technical Rhino talk. This was the first talk of the day, after 
the party night, so it was a little lightly attended. However, those 
that made it there were rewarded with an in-depth understanding of the 
rationale for some performance related design decisions in the 
implementation of Nashorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10:30 slot was another effectively plenary session, but out in the demo area. Stephen Chin's highly effective &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://nighthacking.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;NIGHTHACKING&lt;/a&gt; brand came to GeekOut with a panel discussion on the #java20 theme. The video is &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://nighthacking.com/20-years-of-java-panel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;on the NIGHTHACKING website&lt;/a&gt;. This was a lot of fun, and I got to put my &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://news.cnet.com/Netscape-sharpens-Javagator-plans/2100-1001_3-206700.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Javagator&lt;/a&gt; old-timer test out there. I also had the pleasure of a brief chat with Stephen regarding &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://nighthacking.com/ed-burns-on-jsf-2-3-and-servlet-4-0/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JSF 2.3 and Servlet 4.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/tnurkiewicz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tomasz Nurkiewicz's&lt;/a&gt; session about CompletableFuture, particularly because of its use in the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/110&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Java SE9 HTTP/2 client&lt;/a&gt;.
 Thomas managed to pack a whole lot into a short, well constructed, code
 powered session. It's not easy to explain the differences between 
thenApply(), thenCombine(), thenCompose() and many other methods in the 
API, but Tomasz succeeded. He even surfaced an important naming 
inconsistency between the CompletableFuture API and the 
java.util.Optional API: thenCompose() == flatMap(). For more on this 
topic from Tomasz, check out his blog entry &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/05/java-8-definitive-guide-to.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Definitive Guide to Completable Future&lt;/a&gt;.
 Personally, I think it's a bit bold to give a single blog entry such a 
lofty title, but you can't argue that it does indeed cover the topic 
very well. I meant to ask Tomasz if his code samples from the talk were 
taken from an upcoming book. Tomasz, if you happen to see this little 
blog entry, please plug the book if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had high hopes for the next talk, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/gvsmirnov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Gleb Smirnov's&lt;/a&gt;
 concurrency talk. It was probably a great talk, but sadly this is when 
my jetlag hit hard and I was struggling to keep up. I'll look for the 
video!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a pass for the 15:00 slot due to the afore mentioned jetlag and opted to save my energy for one final session, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/ags313&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Andrzej Grzesik's&lt;/a&gt;
 Go. I'd taken a quick look at Go before the session, so I was in a good
 position to enjoy it. This session made no excuses about having nothing
 to do with Java and instead just tried to give a quick tour of the Go 
language and programming environment, with a view towards lowering the 
barriers to entry to give it a try. Go succeeds because it rules several
 fundamental things as simply out of scope. There is no dynamic linking.
 There is no UI. There is no API to the threading model. There is no 
inheritance. I'm glad Go is out there because sometimes you don't need 
that stuff. For what it's worth, here's a nice post on Go &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://spf13.com/post/is-go-object-oriented/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;from the Docker guy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there were some brief and tasteful closing remarks from ZeroTurnaround founders and my good friends &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ekabanov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jevgeni Kabanov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/toomasr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Toomas Römer&lt;/a&gt;. I'm glad to see these guys doing well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><summary type="html">GeekOut 2015 SummaryI

 switching to the name &quot;ConFESS&quot; in 2011. The name stands for the 
&quot;Conference for Enterprise Software Solutions&quot;. Last year, ConFESS was 
held as a partnership with JavaLand in Brühl Germany. Neither party was 
satisfied with how that turned out and in 2015 ConFESS returned to its 
home in Vienna, where it will stay. It was a relatively small event, 
with just over 200 participants. It nicely filled out the venue, the C3 
event center in the 3rd district. In my opinion, its small size is a 
large asset. The ability to have the entire event schedule on two sides 
of a 4x5 inch card is very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.oracle.com/blog/20150415-confess-2015.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;403&quot; src=&quot;20150518_files/20150415-confess-2015.html&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My
 overall impression of the conference was very positive. There was a 
wide variety of talks from speakers I hadn't seen before on the 
conference circuit. There was a good breadth of coverage in diverse 
tracks ranging from agile/methods to Java EE to tools to client side 
technologies, and there was an excellent band on Tuesday night, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fsgcompany.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Florian Braun and FSG Company&lt;/a&gt;. There was also a Lego Mindstorms EV3 competition that got rave reviews, but I didn't attend that portion of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.oracle.com/blog/20150414_confess-2015.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;404&quot; src=&quot;20150518_files/20150414_confess-2015.html&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full set of abstracts from the conference are available at the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.regonline.com/builder/site/tab2.aspx?EventID=1619724&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;regonline site for the event&lt;/a&gt;.
 You can use that site to learn more about the sessions for which I will
 give my brief impressions in the remainder of this blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tuesday Keynote was from Oracle Labs's &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thomaswue&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Thomas Wuerthinger&lt;/a&gt;. Thomas presented his exciting work on the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oracle-labs/program-languages/overview/index-2301583.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Graal VM&lt;/a&gt;. First off, I'm glad to see that Oracle has continued Sun's tradition of funding long-term research in the spirit of &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems_Laboratories&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sun Labs&lt;/a&gt;,
 founded by computing pioneer Ivan Sutherland (yep, just checked, he 
still works for Oracle). The basic idea of Graal appears to be: take the
 abstract syntax tree concept from compiler design and make it a first 
class part of the JIT process, allowing the runtime to rewrite itself as
 the program runs to achieve greater performance without sacrificing 
agility. Cool stuff, and great for a keynote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking with the JSF heritage of the conference, next up was &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cagataycivici&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cagatay Civici's&lt;/a&gt;
 talk about PrimeFaces. Cagatay introduced the new &quot;layouts&quot; concept, 
built on JSF 2.2 Resource Library Contracts. The base offering consists 
of two new layouts, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.primefaces.org/layouts/sentinel.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.primefaces.org/layouts/spark.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;.
 One thing I've always liked about PrimeFaces is how they take the base 
concepts of the core JSF specification and use them to maximum effect, 
taking full advantage of new features, large and small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diving down a level, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pbouillaud/status/588552316594302976&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Johannes Tuchscherer&lt;/a&gt;
 from CloudFoundry talked about Docker and how it relates to offerings 
from Pivotal. Johannes put the hype into perspective, showing how you 
still need other technologies to actually create value with Docker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sticking in the Pivotal realm, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/springjuergen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Jürgen Höller&lt;/a&gt;
 gave the Spring 4.1 overview talk. It was nice to see that they were 
able to leverage Java SE 8 features while producing a binary that runs 
on Java SE 6. I was happy to have the opportunity to ask Juergen how 
pulled that trick off and the answer is basically build-time static code
 analysis. They compile with Java SE 8 with -source and -target 1.6, and
 have a build-time tool that looks for usages of Java SE 8 only idioms 
and APIs, and flags them as failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next talk I attended was a really practical hands on session about Java Flight Recorder from &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johanjanssen42&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Johan Janssen&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a big fan of learning to get more out of tools I already have. JFR has been a part of the JDK for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I
 was happy to see my good friend and fellow Oracle employee Mike Keith 
given the Wednesday keynote slot. Mike is a veteran of the conference 
trail, author of &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Pro-JPA-Experts-Voice-Java/dp/1430249269&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pro JPA2&lt;/a&gt;
 and former JPA spec lead. Mike was talking about an exciting new 
product from Oracle: Mobile Back End As A Service (MBaaS). In a 
nutshell, this product packages up everything enterprises need to deploy
 mobile based applications that are built on their existing 
infrastructure. Mike's slides are &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://2015.con-fess.com/TJeBJK74/ConFESS_2015_Day2_0900_R1_R2_Mike_Keith-EnterpriseMobilePlatform.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;available for download&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My
 own session was up next, at which I gave a status update on JSF 2.3. 
Briefly, it's a community driven release aimed at preserving your 
existing investment in JSF. I've uploaded my slides to &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/burns-jsfconfess2015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;slideshare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a counterpart to Johan Janssen's session yesterday I attended &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/antonarhipov&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Anton Arhipov&lt;/a&gt;'s session about ZeroTurnaround's &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://zeroturnaround.com/software/xrebel/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;XRebel&lt;/a&gt;
 product. I liked his straightforward pitch: most applications receive 
very little profiling attention, let's make a super simple product that 
lets you get the low hanging fruit with maximum performance gain. 
Indeed, the slick browser based UI is very easy to use. When asked about
 various corner cases, Anton was honest and answered the current state 
of the product is very narrowly focused on where the most value can be 
easily extracted. This focus is a key success factor for ZT, in my 
opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always talked up the importance of maintainability, 
and sold that as a strong suit of the Java EE stack, so it was with 
great interest that I attended &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bernhard_keprt/status/588278982245818369&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bernhard Keprt&lt;/a&gt;'s session about maintenance. One reason I like attending conferences is to remove my &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/secrets-of-the/9780071490832/apb.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3rd order ignorance&lt;/a&gt; by exposing me to technologies I otherwise would not encounter. During Bernhard's talk, he introduced me to &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.versioneye.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VersionEye&lt;/a&gt;.
 The value-add of this tool is easy to perceive: given that you have 
lots of dependencies, let's have a tool that keeps an eye on them and 
lets you know when they update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefan Schuster gave a session 
from his experiences in developing apps for the three big flavors of 
mobile deployment platforms: native, Apache Cordova, and mobile web app.
 I liked this session for its first-hand perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To close out my 2015 ConFESS session attendance I viewed &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alexgoeschl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Alex Göschl&lt;/a&gt;'s session on AngularJS.

 FWIW, I found nine job postings for JSF on the site and four for 
Angular. This was an enjoyable talk and Alex did a great job explaining 
the extremely heterogeneous set of tools and technologies used in the 
project. Prior to switching the jobs portal to Angular 1, they were 
using GWT. It was pretty much a complete rewrite. The most useful aspect
 of the talk to me was the ease with which such an apparently complex 
tool chain is now accepted and leveraged by your average front end team.
 For example, the following nine step dev time build process was rattled
 off as if it were no big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;clean build targets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compile less to css&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;copy vendor libraries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;copy assets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compile and optimize angular templates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;compile and check typescript&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;copy to tomcat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;inject velocity templates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
 must just be my Java EE roots that makes me feel that the preceding 
list is a lot more complex than a similar build process in a Java EE 
stack. I need to spend more time getting to know the workflow in current
 front end shops. Can anyone recommend a user group or meetup in 
Orlando, FL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the two day conference was my full day of 
workshops. I had a small but dedicated room of students and I hope they 
enjoyed the sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><summary type="html">ConFESS 2015 Wrap UpHard on the heels of JavaLand was ConFESS. This was the eighth installment of the conference that started life in 2008 as JSF Days,

enjoyed the sessions.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JavaLand 2015 Wrap-Up Blog</title><link href="/blog/2015/03/30/javaland-2015-wrap.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JavaLand 2015 Wrap-Up Blog" /><published>2015-03-30T09:32:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-30T09:32:00-04:00</updated><id>/blog/2015/03/30/javaland-2015-wrap</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2015/03/30/javaland-2015-wrap.html">&lt;div class=&quot;jive-rendered-content&quot;&gt;&lt;h1&gt;JavaLand 2015 Wrap Up&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After
 months of preparation, it all came down to three days of intense 
execution, and I was just one speaker. I can only marvel at the 
logistical acumen that was on display from the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.javaland.eu/team/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JavaLand&lt;/a&gt; and DOAG team. I had an action , capably coodinated by &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.javaland.eu/personenseiten/andreas-badelt/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Andreas Badelt&lt;/a&gt;.
 Because of the high level of activity on my personal agenda, I was not 
able to attend as many sessions as I would have liked. In any case, this
 blog entry is my place to share my overall impressions of the 
conference, and of the sessions I did get a chance to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Day One&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.oracle.com/blog/20150324-lagergren-keynote-hassle.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;401&quot; src=&quot;20150330_files/20150324-lagergren-keynote-hassle.html&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;148&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Right off the bat, I want to tip my cap to &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lagergren&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Marcus Lagergren&lt;/a&gt;
 for remaining calm in the face of some AV problems. Even with all that,
 and the 45 minute session duration, Marcus managed to give a compelling
 whirlwind tour of his personal experience with Java from the beginning.
 More photos like the one on the right are available from &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hildebrandttk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stefan Hildebrandt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/130465085@N06/sets/72157651139135557/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;flickr photo stream&lt;/a&gt;.
 I think there is a lot more room in the &quot;20 year's of Java meme&quot;, 
however, and I applaud Marcus for wisely not attempting to speak for all
 of it and drawing from his own experiences. That's one great thing 
about the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23java20&amp;amp;src=typd&amp;amp;customTheme=otn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;#java20&lt;/a&gt; meme, everyone has their own story. Maybe at &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/javaone/call-for-proposals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JavaOne 2015&lt;/a&gt; they will have some sort of &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://storycorps.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Story Corps&lt;/a&gt;
 type thing where people can give their stories. Come to think of it, if
 someone wants to build Story Corps as a Service (SCAAS), perpahs they 
can sell it to Oracle for use at the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Marcus's session, I presented with my good friend &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SourceKnights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Oliver Szymanzki&lt;/a&gt; a 45 minute capsule of our full day training session about &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/java-ee-7-from-an-html5-perspective-javaland-2015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Java EE 7 from an HTML5 Perspective&lt;/a&gt;.
 It was tough to make a meaningful abstraction from a full day session 
to just 45 minutes, but I hope at least people could take something 
useful away from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came my first exposure to the EAA, which was my only chance to present JSF content here at JavaLand. I gave a &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/jsf-22-input-output-javaland-2015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;quick presentation&lt;/a&gt;
 and had an informal meeting with several JSF EG members who were at 
JavaLand. We covered f:socket, multi-component validation, and URL 
mapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evening community event was really not to be missed. 
If you ever have a chance to attend JavaLand, I really recommend you 
participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Day Two&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started out the day by presenting a modified version of my &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/http2-comes-to-java-what-servlet-40-means-to-you-devnexus-2015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DevNexus session about Servlet 4.0 and HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt;. I basically dropped the demo and moved the Java SE 9 content to an EAA session in order to fit into the 45 minute window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following my session I was able to enjoy &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nmcl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mark Little's&lt;/a&gt; keynote about Java &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.doag.org/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=483801&amp;amp;locS=0&amp;amp;vid=491907&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Enterprise and Internet of Things&lt;/a&gt;.
 This session put out some hard-won truths of problems we have solved in
 Java as cautionary tales for newer stacks that seem intent on 
re-inventing wheels rather than standing on the shoulders of others. I 
must admit it was a feel-good session, but still realistic and largely &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_the_Kool-Aid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;kool aid free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I supported &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dblevins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;David Blevins&lt;/a&gt; during his &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.doag.org/konferenz/konferenzplaner/konferenzplaner_details.php?id=483801&amp;amp;locS=0&amp;amp;vid=491386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;session about the new Security JSR&lt;/a&gt;. This was a very informative session that got a whole lot done in only 45 minutes. I hope it encouraged some people to &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;get involved in JSR-375&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running back to the EAA, I presented the exciting work being done by &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/OpenJDK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Michael McMahon&lt;/a&gt;
 to bring a new Http Client to Java SE 9, including HTTP/2 support. I 
can't post the slides, but I'm sure we'll have something on this at 
JavaOne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My last engagment of the conference proper was to participate in a joint vJUG/NightHacking session regarding &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://nighthacking.com/adopt-a-jsr-nighthackingvjug-sessions/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Adopt-a-JSR&lt;/a&gt;. This was lots of fun, and I thank &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/steveonjava&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Stephen Chin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sjmaple&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Simon Maple&lt;/a&gt; for providing a vehicle for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
 a nice wind-down from the conference, and a bit of chill before the 
training day, I was invited by DOAG boss Fried Saacke to attend the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dasniko/status/580831517418618883&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;5 year celebration dinner&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.ijug.eu/java-aktuell/das-magazin.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Java Aktuell&lt;/a&gt;
 magazine. I didn't know it at the time, but the invitation included an 
opportunity to give a short speech, in German, on the importance of JCP 
to the Java Community. I hope I didn't mangle my words too badly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.oracle.com/blog/20150326-tastykakes-and-usb.jpeg&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;402&quot; src=&quot;20150330_files/20150326-tastykakes-and-usb.html&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;150&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 After being blessed with many years of German conference opportunities 
at which I invariably bring home lots of chocolate, I felt it was time 
to give the Germans a taste of American-style sweets along with their 
pre-loaded VM usb sticks. These Tasty Kakes or a specialty of my

It will be on the big stage. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java.net/sites/default/files/big-room.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;398&quot; src=&quot;20150115_files/big-room.html&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This year I’m celebrating my own 20 year anniversary with Java, since &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flux.utah.edu/%7Ekwright/paper_summs/network_papers/mweb-w3c96.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;I was present&lt;/a&gt; at the German debut of Java at the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/19980214105213/http://www.igd.fhg.de/www/www95/www95.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;The Third International World-Wide Web Conference in Darmstadt, Germany&lt;/a&gt; in April 1995. I vividly remember someone (&lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/avh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Arthur van Hoff&lt;/a&gt; I think) typing, as root &lt;code&gt;rm -rf /*&lt;/code&gt;, at the end of the demo on a Sun UNIX workstation. What flair!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1000, Schauspielhaus, Praktisches API-Design&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieser Vortrag wird auf Deutsch gegeben, aber trotzdem empfehle sie ich weil das Thema nebem meinem Hertz liegt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java.net/sites/default/files/schauspielhaus.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;399&quot; src=&quot;20150115_files/schauspielhaus.html&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;134&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Hopefully I’ll get some tips for design in JSF and Servlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;p&gt;1200, Quantum 1, Java EE 7 from an HTML5 Perspective: WebSocket, JSON, &amp;amp; JSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
 is my first session, and it is an overview of JavaEE 7 from the 
perspective of technologies useful to those developing JavaEE 7 backed 
apps with HTML5 user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wasn’t speaking myself, I’d attend my pal &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/monacotoni&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Anton Epple’s 1200, Quantum 2, Wie programmiert man JavaScript in Java.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1300, Schauspielhaus, The (not so) Dark Art of Performance Tuning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My good friend &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kcpeppe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kirk Pepperdine&lt;/a&gt; is a global expert in this topic, and a great and entertaining speaker as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1400, Wintergarden, JBatch mit Apache BatchEE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batch
 is one of those unglamorous yet essential technologies, and also one 
with a very vibrant JCP community. I remember meeting &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaelminella&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Michael Minella&lt;/a&gt; of Spring Batch at &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://devnexus.com/s/index&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;DevNexus 2014&lt;/a&gt; and he was so excited about passing the TCK. The session speaker, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/struberg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Mark Struberg&lt;/a&gt;, is a tech titan and one of the sharpest guys I’ve had the pleasure of working with. He’s also a great speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1500, Wintergarden, Where Are We At with MVC in Java EE 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work very closely with my co-spec lead on JSF, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mnriem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Manfred Riem&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m biased, but this session is sure to be great. MVC is one of the most talked about technologies in Java EE 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1600, Quantum 4, Confessions of an Automation Addict&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a bit of an automation addict myself, but the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071804285&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;horse I picked to ride&lt;/a&gt; has fallen out of favor. Nonetheless, I still use it heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1700, Schauspielhaus, Speed up Your Java by Turning it into Binary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John is a great speaker and industry veteran, and this talk has a provocative topic, so it is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;min-height: 8pt; padding: 0px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One
 unique aspect of this conference is its location: a top-tier amusmement
 park. Think of it as a smaller mashup of Disney’s Epcot and Magic 
Kingdom, with German sensibilities. After the first day of the 
conference, some of the rides will be open to conference attendees. My 
favorite was Winja’s force. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java.net/sites/default/files/winjas-force.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img __embedded_id=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;20150115_files/winjas-force.html&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;134&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This is a relatively mellow roller coaster with a twist, literally. The car you sit in can rotate as it glides along the rails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday, 25 March 2015&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;dl&gt;&lt;dt&gt;0900, Quantum 3, Developing Native Mobile Apps Using JavaScript&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a bit outside of my bailiwick, but my friend &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hazems&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hazem Saleh&lt;/a&gt; is a great speaker and strong proponent of Open Source. He’s also a JSF Expert Group member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1000, Schauspielhaus, HTTP 2.0 Comes to Java EE&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is my second session, and I’ll explain what’s in store for Servlet 4.0, with a special view towards HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wasn’t speaking, I’d definitely attend &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/svenpet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sven Peters’s&lt;/a&gt;
 Coding Culture session in Wintergarden. First off, Atlassian makes much
 better products than GitHub. Second, Sven is an excellent speaker, and 
third the talk is likely to be keynote worthy. I’m not glad to be up 
against him in the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1100, Wintergarden, Enterprise and Internet of Things&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tuesday plenary is by &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nmcl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dr. Mark Little&lt;/a&gt;,
 who is doing a great job driving Java EE forward at JBoss. I normally 
don’t go in for IoT sessions, but Mark is sure to make it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1300, Schauspielhaus, Java EE Security: Let’s Make Something Useful&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dblevins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;David Blevins&lt;/a&gt;
 is a strong community voice for improving Java EE, and security is one 
of the most challenging areas to improve. You can tell it’s hard just by
 how long it’s taken for the community to get up enough steam to tackle 
it in a proper JSR. Well, we have one now: &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=375&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JSR-375&lt;/a&gt;, and David will tell us how we can make the most of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1400, Quantum 4, Productive, Effective Development? You Weak Minded fool!&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sjmaple&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Simon Maple&lt;/a&gt; has done a great job building the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/virtualJUG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Virtual JUG&lt;/a&gt;
 into a force for good in the Java Community. He is well positioned to 
deliver this kind of talk thanks to his role at ZeroTurnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1500, Quantum 1, Softwarequalität steigern&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;This
 appears to be a survey talk about how to effectively use some popular 
tools in practice to improve software quality. I’ve never seen &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/leichtundkross&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Andreas G¨nzel&lt;/a&gt; talk, but the topic is interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1600, Quantum 4, Puppet für Entwickler&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now
 that Docker is all the rage, I’ll be interested to see what’s new with 
Puppet, or at least learn how these two popular sysadmin technologies 
relate to eachother. As with the previous talk, I’ve not seen &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ithempel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Sebastian Hempel&lt;/a&gt; speak before this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thursday, 26 March 2015&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/archive/2014/12/26/javaland-2015-training-day-teaser&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;in my previous entry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SourceKnights&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Oliver Szymanski&lt;/a&gt; and I are presenting an entry in the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.javaland.eu/programm/vertiefe-schulungstag.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;training day&lt;/a&gt;: Java EE 7 from an HTML5 Perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JavaLand

 only 61 days to go until JavaLand 2015, it's high time for a preview of
 the Training Day session I am pleased to offer with my friend Oliver 
Szymanksi. Briefly, this session is a full day treatment of the parts of
 Java EE 7 that intersect with the world of HTML5 web development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the session is an update of the successful class we offered at &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/javaone/java-university/index.html#JavaEE7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;JavaOne San Francisco 2014&lt;/a&gt;, it is not a simple repeat. Some major things have happened in the world of HTML5 since JavaOne 2014. Most notably, &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2014/10/html5-rec.html.en&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTML5 has gone final&lt;/a&gt;. In case you missed it, many things that were slated for inclusion in HTML5 have been descoped, as detailed in the &lt;a class=&quot;jive-link-external-small&quot; href=&quot;http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Plan 2014&lt;/a&gt;
 document from W3C. The idea is to reduce HTML5 spec size by splitting 
things into seperate specification efforts. Formerly core ideas such as 
the 2D Canvas, Web Storafe, WebSocket, Server Sent Events and WebRTC 
either already had their own specification effort or now have one. The 
Plan 2014 document justifes this move with some compelling anecdotal 
data, summing it up with this defensive statement, “The evidence shows 
that placing technologies in their own extension specifications, while 
initially controversial in some cases, has proven to be a long-term 
benefit for peace and harmony in the end.” Peace and harmony? I hope so.
 In any case, Oliver and I will break this down and show you what it
