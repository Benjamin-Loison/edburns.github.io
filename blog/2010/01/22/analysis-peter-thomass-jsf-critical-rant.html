    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>There’s this guy, Peter Thomas <img alt="Peter Thomas headshot" class="jive-external-image">,
 and he has this blog entry called “jsf sucks”. I don’t want to increase
 his page rank so I’m not linking to it here. However, it’s certainly a 
popular page since it’s the top link for “jsf sucks” on <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=jsf+sucks&amp;aq=f&amp;aql=&amp;aqi=g2g-s1g2g-s3g2&amp;oq=&amp;customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">google</a>, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=jsf+sucks&amp;go=&amp;form=QBLH&amp;qs=n&amp;customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">bing</a>, and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=jsf+sucks&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=yfp-t-701&amp;customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">Yahoo!</a>.
 I have read the entire blog entry, all of the entries linked from it, 
most of the comments on those entries, and some of the entries linked 
from those entries. It’s a testament to my faith in God that I can 
emerge from such an exercise without feeling a level of guilt tantamount
 to that felt (one hopes) by a<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocidaires" rel="nofollow">genocidaire</a>.</p><span></span><p>I
 started doing a quantitative analysis of the comments on each entry, 
summing up pro- and anti-JSF comments. I only did a spot sampling of 
four entries in this way and each of them came up with more pro-JSF than
 anti-JSF comments. I believe that if someone proceeded with such a 
rotten tomato style analysis, they’d find that most of the entries had 
more pro-JSF than anti-JSF comments.</p><span></span><p>The best summary of Mr. Thomas’s vituperous screed coms from Benny Bottema, in one of the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://blog.projectnibble.org/2009/05/24/jsf-is-a-diamond-in-the-rough-you-just-need-to-make-it-shine/comment-page-1/#comment-685" rel="nofollow">comments</a> on one of his posts, which I’ll quote here.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p style="background: silver; color: black;">Concerning
 your point about a ‘comprehensive list of hyper-linked, verifiable 
references to comments by real people’: I don’t dispute that. I said it 
is an unbalanced pool of information, poisonous in fact. With 
‘nonobjective biased site of propaganda’ I referred to the site owner 
who compiled the list. Anyone can put together a site, only referring to
 articles that say something sucks. That’s just immature. Also the names
 you refer to are irrelevant, old quotes in a time where JSF couldn’t be
 corrected by supplemental frameworks. Take Rod Johnson’s point for 
example, it’s a quote from 2004 about JSF. No mention of its potential 
or combinatorial qualities... simply JSF itself which I already admitted
 is flawed on its own. And this is used as ‘proper’ argument? Useless 
propaganda I say.</p></div><span></span><p>One sensible response to such polemical fulmination is to tag the articles as appropriate using del.icio.us tags.

As I am still considering myself as quite new to Java - especially for 
web development, I looked at the most frameworks that are in the news on
 a regular basis.

For instance tried JSF, GWT with and without Ext GWT, Wicket - I think 
those are the currently top rated frameworks.

I find major drawbacks within all these frameworks. - In JSF I had 
troubles with accessing component data and GUI destroy-issues in the 
designer (using NetBeans of course) - some things not really intuitive 
here. Anyway, looking at GWT the compile time (in the background 
compiling to JavaScript) is awful slow already for a hello world type 
thing, not even trying to imagine compile time for a big application. I 
further had/have rendering issues with Ext GWT. I loved the Wicket 
because it got rid of all the XML shit (I really hate XML because in 90 %
 of the cases it is used in a field where other formats would do a 
better job - just of the fact that the format makes it impossible to 
write a performant parser) - I love that plain Java idea. However, I 
found that it lacks GUI elements (at least looks like that for me) and 
it is completely missing a GUI editor as GWT is that missing also on the
 NetBeans side (and don't know about the quality of the plugin for 
Eclipse). - And yes, WYSIWYG GUI design is an essential point for me.

So I think, the optimum framework is yet to come, none of those I found 
is really making me happy. However, even after reading a lot of negative
 stuff about JSF I am quite sure that JSF would not be the worst 
decision. - I didn't settle for a specific framework yet. For those who 
now come over with the argument that for each project the best fitting 
should be chosen, let me say: I am working in a small company where it 
is extremely important that my components are reusable for other 
projects because often one customer is not willing to pay the real 
amount of work so that we have to count on multiple times selling things
 to create the revenue. So I cannot create the same things in different 
projects all the time for new (there are some elements needed in quite 
every app and so I would have to build same things over and over again 
for each framework).

I am quite on the newest stuff (Java 6, NetBeans 6.8) and don't have 
legacy Java projects that would tie me to a particular framework. So I 
am also not prestressed. Decision is very hard for me, but e.g. when 
looking on this - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93uciX4eUbQ - I have 
doubts that web applications in general are way too hyped and I will 
think twice before setting up an application as web app. It's mostly the
 Windows development guys suffered from those plenty setup problems 
doing everything as web application now. But it could be so easy by 
downloading and double clicking a jar (or even just use a JNLP Java 
webstart link. Sure, there are applications that are supposed to be a 
web app - and I am still not sure which framework to settle on. Habe to 
try them all again I think.

But my main message is: The existing frameworks are all great and all 
suck to some extent. But I am happy that I did not settle on .NET 
(although I come from Windows development realm) because there I have 
only one choice that ever works on Java too if I want to avoid any of 
those frameworks.

First of all: I spent almost one day reading through Peter’s link list 
(almost, because some of the comments, posts, etc were already known to 
me) and Ed’s response. That was a great kind of work, to analyze and 
categorize nearly all of the not always that objective third person 
comments, without becoming polemic yourself.
<br><br>
The project currently uses JSF2 (reference implementation) without any 
additional component library or extensions in a midsize project, that 
heavily depends on a custom design, a sometimes clumsy old CMS for 
editorial maintenance and third-party javascript integration for fancy 
effects. The underlying domain logic is complex enough for not being 
comparable with rather simple “example” applications like blogs or 
guestbooks.
<br><br>
From my perspective Mojarra 2.0.2 seems to be more mature than the 
currently used and recently released DI container spring 3.0.0 and I 
suppose the quality (documentation, test coverage) of springsource 
products is one of the best around in the opensource world.
<br><br>
Following Peter’s and followers pain reports, I have to admit JSF is 
indeed a highly complex piece of software for web application 
development. Not comparable with Struts in any way for example. If you 
are planning to introduce JSF for a new project, I would like to advice 
you to get some people with JSF experience for your team. With “JSF 
experience” I mean guys, who have actually read the specification, know 
why things do not behave as expected and could explain this other team 
members. In general the problem is not caused by JSF, but rather by the 
developer who misunderstood some of the concepts of JSF.
<br><br>
From my experiences the creation of controllers, converters and 
validators and the usage preexisting component is not a problem for JSF 
unexperienced developers. There is none to little of API in form of 
simple interfaces or event classes to fiddle around with. But if you are
 going to change some of the fundamental behaviours of JSF, you need to 
get in touch with all these classes that are used in some phases or 
thoughout the whole request lifecycle. There are so many extension 
points in JSF, that even experienced developers often do not get the 
right point in the first place for their implementation requirements. I 
have not count them all, but making a rough guess I would say there are 
about two to three dozen of extension points for an application. These 
are mainly accessible via decorator or bridge pattern, that is why there
 are so many abstract classes are out there.
<br><br>
Even though these extension points are one of the reasons for JSF’s 
complexity I love them. I love them because they enable my team to 
create awesome application with high level abstraction in general from 
protocols, states and so on in general, but the ability to extend at
low level where needed.

Sun is now speaking everywhere about J2EE 6 and JSF2, but unfortunetely 
for those of us working on the field, these are dreams still far far 
away.

On my job, I have to handle with JSF 1.2 applications that are running 
on top of JSP 2.0 (that's right, no typo) containers, thanks to Facelets
 and a few jar hacks.

These are very important customers, but they won't update any time soon 
for a JSF 2, compliant container. And this&nbsp; is true for many of us 
out there.

So what? Almost every customer using Struts or Spring MVC or even plain 
Servlets won't take the risk to move to anything else either.<br>
It's better to start new projects with JSF2 than trying to convince your
 customers into upgrading the app they already spend millions on and 
which satisfies their need for the moment.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point: JSF1.2 and JSF2.0 are great frameworks. I've been 
following JSF since 2004. Oh dear, JSF1.0 was far from perfect. JSF1.1 
was much better already, and JSF1.2 just works fine.<br>
From there on, I consider JSF2.0 as a set of major improvements on 
something that already proved to be reliable and ready for production. I
 have myself put a few medium-to-big JSF projects into production 
without any serious problem during development or deployment. Indeed, if
 you take advantage of the extension abilities of the framework, and use
 Facelets (now standard), and RichFaces/IceFaces on top, you can build 
great websites really fast. Naturally you need to climb the learning 
curve, but it's not harder than any other framework.<br>
<br>
So many people criticize JSF1.0 in 2010...the same way they criticize 
EJB2 (regarding other CDI discussions). It's irrelevant and not worth 
commenting on.<br>
What if I started criticizing the Boeing Stratocruiser, initially based 
on a B-29 and released in 1950? Wouldn't you say I'm dishonnest not to 
talk about the 787 Dreamliner and its first flight last month?<br>
<br>
So many people also fail to understand a standard like JSF passes 
through a complex process in a whole EE release. It's serious stuff, it 
involves dozens of projects, hundreds of people, and puts the Java world
 at stake every time. And you need to make compromises. But the next 
version will fill the gaps, as with every other framework.... except 
other frameworks will evolve in beta version for years, regardless of 
any constraint or backwards compatibility...but it seems many wanna-be 
architects take the word "standard" as an insult. And it's just awkward 
and stupid.<br>
<br>
And some recurring arguments, like bookmarkable URLs are also 
irrelevant. I never had a problem with them. All you need to do is 
specify #{param.args} in the managed bean behind your page in 
faces-config.xml, write the appropriate setters in that bean, and handle
 the logic in a @PostConstruct...If you can't do it easily, you need to 
RTFM again. JSF2.0 makes it even easier. Great, we should be thankful 
for that!<br>
<br>
Personally I've stopped trying to convince people with prejudice to use 
JSF. If they don't want to use it, fine by me. I'm just expecting they 
leave me alone.<br>
There are other very good solutions for enterprise use or not (GWT, 
Flex, Wicket, etc) and I respect that. They are really cool stuff too, 
with strong points and flaws as well, naturally.<br>
However, I have personally seen Ed Burns making a presentation of JSF2, 
coding a few examples live, and literally convincing the crowd it was a 
really strong framework. THAT tells volumes.
