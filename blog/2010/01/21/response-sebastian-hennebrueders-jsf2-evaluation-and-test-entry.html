 in November, Sebastian Hennebrueder published a detailed, thoughtful, 
and mostly objective analysis of JSF2. I'd like to use this entry to 
respond to his entry, which may be found at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.laliluna.de/jsf-2-evaluation-test.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.laliluna.de/jsf-2-evaluation-test.html</a>. I have excerpted the parts of his article that pertain to my comments here.</p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><table class="tab_fs01"><tbody><tr><td class="head_fs01" style="">JSF 2 - evaluation and test&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=""><br>&nbsp; <div dir="LTR"><div dir="LTR">&nbsp;</div></div><h1 class="western">Introduction</h1><p>JSF is a standard to implement Java based web framework. There is a reference implementation of the standard, Mojarra JSF...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[...]</p><p>Add the following libraries to the build path of the web application.</p><ul><li><p>jsf-api-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</p></li><li><p>jsf-impl-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT .jar</p></li><li><p>jstl 1.2</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns: Why do you need JSTL? That's only necessary if you're using JSP. This is a bug in the implementation and not the spec. <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://javaserverfaces.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1517" rel="nofollow">1517</a>.</p></div></li></ul><p>The
 deployment approach for JSF libraries is slightly picky. Glassfish 
provides already JSF 2 libraries. You may need to update them using the 
update mechanism of Glassfish. Just search for ?glassfish JSF2? to find 
more...</p><p>[...]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4 class="western">Modify the web.xml</h4><p>The
 Servlet class FacesServlet starts the JSF request processing life cycle
 and must be defined in the web.xml. The servlet mapping tag defines the
 for which URL the FacesServlet should be executed. The pattern /faces/*
 is commonly used by the JSF specification but any other prefix or 
extension is possible. The example uses as web-app attribute 
version=?2.5? this means we are using servlet-api version 2.5. If you 
use tomcat 6 we need minimum servlet-api in version 2.5. Compared with 
jsf 1.2 nothing changed in this example.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns:
 If you are on Glassfish v3 final you don't even need a web.xml at all. 
The /faces/* and *.xhtml url-patterns are mapped by default to the 
FacesServlet. Also, if you're using Glassfish V3, please set the version
 to 3.0.</p></div><p>Below you can see the <i>web.xml</i>...</p><p>[...]</p><h4 class="western">Technical details</h4><p>The
 following diagram shows all places where events listener are called. 
The diagram is slightly simplified. The FacesServlet is the entry point 
of the JSF application. It calls the lifecycle, which in return executes
 the different phases. Every phase calls global phase event listener 
before and after the actual work is done. Sample: 3 and 4 in the <i>RestoreView</i> phase.</p><p>PhaseEvent
 listener can be defined per view as well. These listener are called by 
the root component, UIViewRoot. This happens in the diagram for example 
at 9 and 14.</p><p>FaceEvents (alias Application events) are broadcasted
 by the UIViewRoot component. This happens in every phase. Sample: 12, 
21, 28, ?</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns: This sequence diagram is excellent!</p></div><p>System events are broadcasted immediately at various points in JSF. Just search the source code for <i>publishEvent</i>...</p><p>[...]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The
 second problem of standardizing is that a standard is a compromise and 
it progresses very slowly. A compromise does not include very innovative
 or individual features and needs to ensure that it doesn't change 
vertically. Changing vertically means that it adds more responsibility 
as it had before. In JSF 1.x Ajax behaviour were not defined. Every 
component provider solved Ajax requirements differently and now JSF 2 
introduces its own mechanism.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns: 
This mechanism was designed by the component vendors who built Ajax 
components for JSF 1.2. The point of the standard jsf.js file is that 
those vendors will be able to drop their proprietary JavasScript code 
and use the standard one, thus allowing component interoperability.</p></div><p>There is a fair chance that components...</p><p>[...]</p><h4 class="western">Components</h4><p>JSF
 offers two types of components: composite components and the classic 
ones. Composite components are introduced with JSF 2. I would call it a 
snippet instead of component, which allows to render a number of 
components using a single custom tag. I think that it is a mistake to 
introduce a new component approach and to leave the old heavy components
 which have quite a number of contracts to follow.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns:
 As you point out, we are committed to backward compatibility and wanted
 to allow JSF 1.2 style components to work. More importantly, composite 
components build on top of the infrastructure of 1.2 style components.</p></div><p>Composite components are of course a great help...</p><p>[...]</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns:
 Doch, every composite component has an optional "top level component" 
which can be in Java or in Groovy. This top level component is an actual
 JSF UIComponent and has access to all of its children component 
declared in the XHTML. Furthermore, it can override any of the 
UIComponent methods to take special action in the lifecycle.</p></div><p>Writing custom components is frequently... used to ensure a consistent look and feel in</p><p>[...]</p>
 large enterprise application. Modern frameworks like Google Web Toolkit
 (GWT), Tapestry or Wicket try to make this as simple as possible. As a 
consequence, it is a common and frequently task for developers using 
those technologies. In JSF writing of components is a job for experts 
only. In fact most people use only finished component collections and 
would never write a component themselves. In my opinion, this is one of 
the strongest weaknesses of JSF 1.x and it is not fixed with JSF 2 and 
as the JSF interest groups are mostly industry companies preferring 
backward compatibility over efficiency and innovation we won't even see 
it fixed in any JSF version.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns:
 You depart here from your normally objective analysis to make opinions 
about the difficulty of building components in JSF2. Composite 
components ARE true JSF UI components. They have properties, methods, 
events, can support listeners, converters, validators and facets. They 
can be as simple as a single XHTML file, or as complex as to involve 
CSS, Script, and Ajax.</p></div><h4 class="western">Scopes</h4><p>JSF introduces now a flash scope...</p><p>[...]</p><h4 class="western">Validation</h4><p>The validation can be ajaxified with the new<i>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</i>
 tag. Leaving an input field will validate the input for that field. An 
Ajax request is sent to the server, which causes a partial processing of
 the input element. This is much better than waiting for a form submit 
but could cause DOS attacks against the server.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns: This is true for <strong>any</strong> Ajax solution. This is not a fault of JSF. Any Ajax allows users to leave themselves open to this problem.</p></div><p>Just press the TAB-button, let the cursor jump from input field to input...</p><p>[...]</p><p>The
 integration of the Hibernate Validation framework (Bean Validation 
spec) looked liked a great improvement on the first view. You add 
annotations like <i>@Size</i> or <i>@Length</i> to a field of the 
managed bean or directly in an entity bean. This allows to use the same 
set of validation rules for Hibernate and for JSF. This is pretty nice 
and the integration works like a charm. The problem is actually not a 
problem of JSF but of Bean Validation. Somehow in the last moment, they 
changed the group validation to use class name instead of strings.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns: Ah yes, type safety is a knife that cuts both ways, isn't it?</p></div><p>Group validations are an important feature to...</p><p>[...]</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To
 summarize, the lack of a DI container as core of the framework is a 
disadvantage of JSF. I assume that this is again a tribute to be 
backward compatible.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns: I'm quite 
sure that if JSF introduced its own DI container then you'd be saying 
something like, "this is yet another reason why JSF is bloated...". The 
fact is, the</p><p>[...]</p> JSF EG is not the DI EG. Different experts,
 different expertise. Also, separation of concerns is vitally important.
 Surely you know that innovation happens elsewhere.&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p></div><h4 class="western">Future of web frameworks</h4><p>I
 will add this section after the Devoxx conference end of November. It 
is an outlooked how component oriented frameworks could change....</p><p>[...]</p><h2 class="western">Security</h2><p>There is no build in security but you will find examples how to integrate JSF with Spring Security.</p><div style="color: red;"><p>edburns:
 What do you mean by that? We've had the ability to encrypt the view 
state since JSF 1.2. Security is a cross cutting concern that was baked 
into every design decision.</p></div><p>If you use JSF with JBoss Seam,...</p><p>[...]</p></td></tr></tbody></table><span></span><p><span class="technoratitag">Technorati Tags: <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/edburns" rel="nofollow">edburns</a></span></p></div>
