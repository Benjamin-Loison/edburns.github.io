    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>This
 brief blog entry explains the Mojarra bug triage process, and shares 
some tips for maximizing the chances your bug will be quickly fixed and 
find its way into a release. Mojarra is the JSF implementation in 
several app servers and is the source code from which the reference 
implementation of the JSF specification is derived.</p><span></span><p>Mojarra has had a publically accessable issue tracker <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES-1" rel="nofollow">since 2004</a>,
 and was the first part of the Java platform to do so. Oracle uses 
Atlassian JIRA as the issue tracking software for its JavaEE 
technologies, and the Mojarra JIRA is at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES" rel="nofollow">https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES</a>&gt;. You need to get a java.net id to be able to file bugs on any such JIRAs. You can get one at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/people/new?customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">https://java.net/people/new</a>&gt;.</p><span></span><h3>How to speed your way though the bug fixing process</h3><span></span><p>The
 first question on your mind when you find a bug in Mojarra is, "how 
quickly can I see this fixed?" The first thing to check is whether or 
not it has been fixed already. It happens! The Mojarra team puts out 
regular releases of the most recent two revisions of the JSF spec. 
Currently these are 2.1 and 2.2. Follow the steps in this entry in the 
JSF FAQ at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://wikis.oracle.com/display/GlassFish/JavaServerFacesRI#JavaServerFacesRI-HowdoIupdatetheJSFimplementationintheJavaEESDK%28orglassfish%29withthemostrecentversion%3F" rel="nofollow">http://jsf.java.net/faq/</a>&gt; to update the Mojarra implementation in GlassFish. The steps for other containers are beyond the scope of this blog entry.</p><span></span><p>If
 your bug still manifests itself in the most recent version of Mojarra 
for the JSF spec version you're using, the next step is to build a 
short, self-contained (compilable) executable (<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://sscce.org/" rel="nofollow">SSCCE</a>)
 showing the bug. This is the single most important thing to speed your 
way through the bug fixing process. In fact, most of the time in fixing a
 bug is reproducing it and writing the regression test for it. Neither 
of these things require access to the Mojarra source code. The Mojarra 
team has published maven archetypes to make this easy. Follow the steps 
in the entry in the JSF FAQ at &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://wikis.oracle.com/display/GlassFish/JavaServerFacesRI#JavaServerFacesRI-HowdoIcreateaShortSelfcontainedCorrect%28Compilable%29Exampleforabugreport%3F" rel="nofollow">http://jsf.java.net/faq/</a>&gt; for instructions on how to use the maven archetypes to quickly create as SSCCE.</p><span></span><p>Once
 you are sure the bug still reproduces on the most recent code and you 
have an SSCCE, you are ready to file a JIRA for it. You will quickly run
 into the problem of attachments. For security purposes, the uploading 
of attachments was disabled except for individuals that have the 
Developer role in JIRA. To work around this limitation, send the SSCCE 
as an email attachment to<code>issues AT javaserverfaces DOT java DOT net</code>. To subscribe to this list, visit &lt;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jsf.java.net/mailinglists.html" rel="nofollow">http://jsf.java.net/mailinglists.html</a>&gt;.
 Once it's in the JIRA, if you really want to ensure fast action, try to
 get others to vote for the issue. Issues that have ten or more votes 
will receive top priority attention, as evidenced by this <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=show&amp;requestId=11912" rel="nofollow">JIRA query showing all such issues</a>. To vote for an issue, just click on the "Vote for it" link on the main page for the issue.</p><span></span><h3>How the Mojarra team triages bugs</h3><span></span><p>(This text is taken directly from the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://wikis.oracle.com/display/GlassFish/JavaServerFacesRI#JavaServerFacesRI-Howdowetriageandassignbugs%3F" rel="nofollow">JSF FAQ</a>).</p><span></span><p>Bugs filed in the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/jira/browse/JAVASERVERFACES" rel="nofollow">Mojarra Issue Tracker</a>
 are triaged by the Mojarra team with the goal of maximizing the number 
of bugs resolved and minimizing the effort taken to resolve them.&nbsp; 
The most important ingredient to achieve this goal is responsiveness: 
first on the part of the Mojarra team and second on the part of the 
reporter.</p><span></span><p>The Mojarra team will do its best to respond to all bugs within four weeks of filing.</p><span></span><p>The
 remainder of this answer will describe the lifetime of a bug in two 
scenarios.&nbsp; Both of these scenarios assume the Mojarra team is 
holding up its end of the responsiveness bargain.</p><span></span><ol><li>The fully responsive reporter.&nbsp; <ol><li>Arrive at an SSCCE.&nbsp;</li><li>Work on the bug begins in earnest&nbsp; <ol><li>Once
 an SSCCE for the bug is in hand, work on the fix can begin.&nbsp; 
During&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bug fix, the Mojarra team may need more 
information to work toward a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolution.&nbsp; With a 
fully responsive reporter, this information is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
provided within four weeks of its being requested by the Mojarra 
team.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as no more than four weeks go by without
 a response, the bug&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will remain in the "fully 
responsive reporter" process.&nbsp; In this case,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the 
Mojarra team works on the bug and makes regular progresses at 
least&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; once every four weeks.&nbsp; Occasionally 
progress becomes blocked awaiting a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; response from the 
reporter.&nbsp; If four weeks go by without a response, 
the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bug will enter the "unresponsive reporter" 
process.</li></ol></li><li>Bug resolution&nbsp; <ol><li>Once the bug has
 been resolved, it is committed to the appropriate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
source code lines and made available for the next release of Mojarra.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>The unresponsive reporter.&nbsp; <ol><li>Request for information&nbsp; <ol><li>If
 the Mojarra team requests more information on a bug report, such as to 
arrive at an SSCCE, or to ask if the bug still exists when tried with 
the latest available appropriate mojarra release, but the reporter does 
not respond to the request within four weeks, the bug will be 
de-prioritized one level from its existing priority.&nbsp; <ol><li>after four weeks of inactivity: Major is de-prioritized to Minor</li><li>after eight weeks of inactivity: Minor is de-prioritized to Trivial</li><li>In
 all cases, the "Major" JIRA priority is the maximim 
allowable&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; priority for bugs in the triage 
process.&nbsp; The Mojarra team uses the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Critical" 
and "Blocker" priorities to prioritize bugs on which 
work&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has actively started.</li><li>If a response is 
given by the reporter, the bug leaves the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "unresonsive
 reporter" process and returns to the "responsive&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
reporter" process.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Bug resolution&nbsp; <ol><li>After twelve weeks of inactivity, the trivial issue is closed as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incomplete.</li><li>This <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&amp;requestId=11904" rel="nofollow">JIRA query</a> contains issues closed as incomplete.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><span></span><p>I
 hope this quick blog entry can help increase the quality of the Mojarra
 JSF implementation by helping the Mojarra team solve more issues 
quickly.</p><span></span><p>20130716-1558 UTC updated: made Mojarra team responsiveness commitment less specific.</p></div>
