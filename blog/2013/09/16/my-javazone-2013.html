    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>I had the pleasure of speaking at JavaZone in Oslo this year. Here is a collection of links of the talks I attended.</p><span></span><ul><li><p>Hadi
 Hariri from JetBrains plugs his Kotlin based JavaScript web app 
framework. Ample context is given to place this offer in the context of 
the new crop of thin-server architecture solutions.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=9f99231c" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>Mario
 Fusco from RedHat gives a masterful session that drove home the 
practical use for Lambda Expressions in the Java language. The entire 
talk was given in the IDE with no slides.</p><p>Mario's talk isn't up yet, but when it is, it will probably be<a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=d40c5f97" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p></li><li><p>Kevlin
 Henney pontificates about how to write a method. I applaud him for 
emphasizing fundamentals. It takes courage to get up there and take a 
strong stand on such personal matters as the meaning of column 80 and 
the need for injection and validation in enterprise software.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=2a76ea4d" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>Brian
 McCallister's talk garnered a whole slew of re-tweets. It really is a 
treasure trove of open source projects that you can pick up and start 
using right now (if your employer's third-party license policy allows 
it). This talk is essentially a curated list with explainers for each 
item.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=32322014" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>I've
 never been to TED, but Matthew McCullough's excellent talk made me feel
 like I was at one. Though it felt through and through like a recruiting
 pitch for GitHub (and a very compelling one at that) there was plenty 
of great soft skills content to make any workplace more effective.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=8ba1af94" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>Viktor
 Klang also got back to fundamentals in this entertaining talk about the
 essential art of software maintenance. Amusingly some of his advice 
contradicted that of Mr. Henney.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=b5d6bd92" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>It's
 hard to disupte that the JavaEE world owes a debt of thanks to Gavin 
King for his contributions to Hibernate and CDI. Personally, I think CDI
 has been a big success factor for JavaEE. Unfortunately, this talk 
about Ceylon did not do a very good job convincing me of its value. I'll
 chalk it up to Gavin just having an off performance. Lord knows I've 
had those myself.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=c36fd633" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>Trisha
 Gee gave a nice soft-skills talk about the importance of design in a 
post-agile methods world. I probably asked too many questions. Sorry 
about that.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=d87f23dd" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>Ulf
 Lilleengen from Yahoo!'s Oslo office talks about how they handle 
configuration in their gigantic enterprise. I was very interested in 
this one because I'm a big believer that we need a JSR for this in Java.
 See Mike Keith's talk <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2013/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=7755" rel="nofollow">at JavaOne next week.</a></p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=6191460a" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>I
 was a bit skeptical coming into this one, but Nate's stage command 
carried the day. Again, the value of this talk was his curation of the 
content. You could plug yourself into this talk and come away knowing 
where to invest further time learning how to use one of these MV* things
 in practice.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=4c78f1e3" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li><li><p>I'm
 just including my own talk here in the interest of completeness. As far
 as delivery goes, I was happy with how it went off. The camera angle in
 this room (which was the same as Gavin King's room) makes it look like 
no-one was there, but there were in fact about 20 - 30 people there.</p><p><a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=aa9e0b96" rel="nofollow">Video</a></p></li></ul></div>
