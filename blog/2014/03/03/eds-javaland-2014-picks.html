    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>This entry lists Ed’s picks for the brand new <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://javaland.eu/" rel="nofollow">JavaLand</a>
 conference. Many of the talks are in German, but there is enough 
English to make it worth your time. It looks like there is a lot more 
English content in day two. Also, the conference was endorsed by 
java.net editor Kevin Farnham in his <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blog/editor/archive/2014/03/01/java-conferences-id-attend-if-i-had-several-free-months-wander-europe-part-2-javaland?customTheme=otn" rel="nofollow">blog post from Saturday, 1 March 2014</a>.</p><h2>Monday 25 March 2014</h2><ul><li><p>Welcome and Keynote, Fried Saacke, 9am, Wintergarden</p><p>Currently
 this entire slot is earmarked for Fried Saacke. I suspect they are 
going to have Fried do the introduction and then have a well known 
speaker do a keynote presentation, but they haven’t listed who yet. 
Nonetheless, I expect it will be good.</p></li><li><p>Go Reactive: Blueprint for Future Applications, Roland Kuhn, 10am, Quantum2</p><p>This
 talk points out several environmental considerations that are different
 about building applications now and then shows how the applications we 
build in light of such considerations are different</p></li><li><p>Moderne UIs mit server-seitigem Model View ViewModel (MVVM), Manfred Geiler and Thomas Spiegel, 11am, Irian City Stage</p><p>This
 talk, by the original authors of Apache MyFaces argues that the server 
side UI facade is not dead yet as an architectural pattern, but rather 
is one tool in a growing toolbox for building modern applications.</p></li><li><p>55 New Features ofJava SE 8, Simon Ritter, 12pm, Wintergarden</p><p>The name says it all. This seems like a good single source for reducing all your ignorance of Java SE 8 to be <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OrdersOfIgnorance" rel="nofollow">second level or less</a>.</p></li><li><p>Are you still manually coding your UIs, Maximillian Kögel, 1pm, Eclipse City Stage</p><p>This
 talk sounds the old “look what you can do with technology that 
separates UI semantics from rendering” meme, this time with an Eclipse 
project called EMF Forms. This technology isn’t new, so it will be 
interesting to see how it has matured.</p></li><li><p>Tragfähige Frontend-Architekturen, Till Schulte-Coerne, 2pm, Quantum 1</p><p>Contrasts
 Resource Oriented Client Architecture (ROCA) with Single Page 
Application architecture as a means to develop more dynamic user 
interfaces.</p></li><li><p>A New Approach to the UI for Distributed Applications, Me, 4pm, Wintergarden</p><p>See <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/konferenz/vortrag_details_jl.php?locS=0&amp;kid=466605&amp;tag=25.03.14&amp;id=471617" rel="nofollow">the abstract.</a></p></li><li><p>Mechanisch, sympathisch, sucht, Pavlo Baron, 5pm, Codecentric City Stage</p><p>This
 one caught my eye because I like chocolate. I hope the presenter gives 
out Ritter Sports to all attendees. Even if he does not, it looks like a
 fun talk that invites the attendee to critique the presenter’s design 
for a high throughput system with minimal hardware.</p></li></ul><h2>Tuesday 26 March 2014</h2><ul><li><p>Reaktive Programmerierung, Niko Köbler, 09am, Schauspielhaus</p><p>I’m
 a fan of old-fashioned Object Oriented programming and, as such, am a 
skeptic of the new style of reactive programming. Perhaps Niko and Heiko
 will convince me.</p></li><li><p>Perceptual Computing und die nächste Welle der Native Interfaces, Thomas Endres, 10am, Quantum 2</p><p>As
 one who has long been working in the world of Web UIs, this talk about 
breaking the fourth wall and having the User Interface be a part of the 
real world looks really interesting. Plus, their <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://parrotsonjava.com/" rel="nofollow">demos</a> look really awesome.</p></li><li><p>Threading Bugs - Some War Stories, Heinz Kabutz, 11am, Wintergarden.</p><p>This
 is a keynote, so there are no other talks going on at the same time. 
Nonetheless, I’d probably choose this one anyway as Heinz is a titan and
 a great speaker.</p></li><li><p>Datenbank DevOps für Entwickler, Michael Hütterman, 12pm, Quantum 1</p><p>Michael is an expert on the emerging field of DevOps. It looks like a nice introductory talk about the topic.</p></li><li><p>The Little Heart of Big Enterprises, Me, 1pm, Irian City Stage</p><p>Best to just <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javaland.eu/konferenz/vortrag_details_jl.php?locS=0&amp;kid=466605&amp;tag=26.03.14&amp;id=476075" rel="nofollow">see the abstract</a>.</p></li><li><p>Play: “One Web Framework to Rule Them All”, Felix Müller, 2pm, Wintergarden</p><p>I’ve
 seen James Ward himself give a talk on Play, so I have a pretty high 
bar. However, that was before Play 2, and according to the abstract the 
framework has been completely rewritten in Scala. I’m not sure why you 
wouldn’t just use Akka in that case, but I guess I’ll find out here.</p></li><li><p>Building Modern Applications Using JBoss and OpenShift, Pete Muir, 3pm, Quantum 1</p><p>I
 know Pete from the CDI spec and he’s a good speaker (if a quick one). 
This looks like a pitch for JBoss Forge, but I’ll allow him that and say
 it’s probably going to be a good talk anyway.</p></li><li><p>Das Avatar-Framework: JavaScript-Binding f</p></li></ul></div>
