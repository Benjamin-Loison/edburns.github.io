    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Update 1: added content about Greg Wilkin's Async IO session.</p>&nbsp; <p>The
 first real day of the conference began with session one of two 
obligatory Oracle booth duty assignments.&nbsp; Our booth had two foci: 
showing off Java EE 7 using the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://cargotracker.java.net/" rel="nofollow">Cargo Tracker Blueprints Application</a>
 and providing insight into our plans for Java EE 8.&nbsp; To spice 
things up a bit and perhaps draw some people in, I brought along my 
kit-built homebrew Theremin, pictured here. <a href="https://community.oracle.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-14343-149453/20140929-theremin.jpeg"><img __embedded_id="393" alt="Homebrew Theremin" src="20141007_files/20140929-theremin.png" style="float: right;" width="110" height="70"></a>
 In my opinion, Java EE 8 is all about solidifying the platform by 
increasing cohesion between the already loosely copuled parts, while 
making incremental improvements to the parts of the platform that relate
 directly to building HTML5 delivered web applications and hosting them 
on the cloud. I've taken the liberty of uploading David Delabassee's 
excellent Java EE 8 slides <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/javaone-2014-java-ee-8-booth-slides" rel="nofollow">to slideshare</a> (Congrats on the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/03/linkedin-acquires-professional-content-sharing-platform-slideshare-for-119m/" rel="nofollow">$118 million payout, by the way</a>.)&nbsp;
 I always enjoy doing booth duty.&nbsp; I look at it like I'm a TA doing
 office hours: if people want to catch me at JavaOne, this is the best 
time for it.</p>&nbsp; <p>Another fun aspect of JavaOne is how it all 
blends together.&nbsp; Towards the end of my booth duty session, my 
colleague and Servlet co-spec lead <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://weblogs.java.net/blogs/swchan2" rel="nofollow">Shing Wai Chan</a>
 stopped by and we put the finishing touches on our slides for "CON5898 -
 What Servlet 4.0 Means to You".&nbsp; Of all the JavaOne conference 
sessions and BOFs in which I played a role this year, this was to be the
 most technical.&nbsp; I've uploaded the slides to <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/con5898-what-servlet-40-means-to-you" rel="nofollow">slideshare</a>.&nbsp; <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://delabassee.com/blog/" rel="nofollow">David Delabassee</a>
 tells me this one will be in the first or second group to be uploaded 
to Parleys.&nbsp; There were 162 pre-registrations for the session and 
I'd estimate there were about 200 in the room.&nbsp; The session was 
notable for being the only Java EE session that featured Java SE 9 
technical content.&nbsp; After explaining the why and how of HTTP2, as 
well as how it may be exposed in the Servlet 4.0 API, I included some 
content on <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/110" rel="nofollow">JEP110</a>,
 the HTTP2 client for Java SE 9.&nbsp; Both the client and server side 
are still very undefined at this point, but it's good to give people an 
insight into where we're going.</p>&nbsp; <p>Directly after the Servlet 
4.0 session, we lead a parade over to the Sutter conference room in the 
Hilton for the combined JSF 2.3/Servlet 4.0 EG kick-off meeting.&nbsp; 
While a pale shadow of its <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.dzone.com/links/rss/jsf_20_eg_kick_off_meeting_buy_a_feature.html" rel="nofollow">former self</a>, it was still a useful meeting.&nbsp; The full audio has been <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://java.net/projects/javaserverfaces-spec-public/downloads/download/JSF_2_3/Early%20Draft%20Review/20140929-servlet4-jsf23-eg-audio.m4a" rel="nofollow">uploaded to the project area on java.net</a>
 for both Servlet and JSF.&nbsp; My intention for the meeting was to 
establish the scope for these two specs and decide on next steps.&nbsp; 
One big take-away, suggested by Greg Wilkins, is the need for additional
 use cases for HTTP2 server push, aside from the obvious and important 
one of a web framework that has a-priori knowledge of the resources that
 are associated with a given web page. We all took the action item to 
look for such cases and share them with the EG.&nbsp; Another notable 
item for the kick-off meeting was an interesting idea from Neil 
Griffin.&nbsp; Neil suggested we might investigate using our announced 
dependency on Java SE 8 and its built-in JavaScript engine, to increase 
the dynamism of JSF apps.&nbsp; Briefly, Neil's idea is to introduce a 
lifecycle phase after render-response that would do some processing on 
the rendered view to prepare it for quick display in the browser DOM, 
delivering a direct-to-DOM view of the page.&nbsp; I asked Neil to think
 about it some more and consider sharing the idea on the EG list.</p>&nbsp; <p>As
 a general rule, I like to listen at more than I talk, but today the 
only session I was able to attend was Greg Wilkins's CON2236 Async IO 
session.&nbsp; The slides have already been posted at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/2014/connect/fileDownload/session/6D6398FC71F37F047848605EBA870D9D/CON2236_Wilkins-AsyncServletIO-JavaOne2014.pdf" rel="nofollow">the JavaOne website</a>.&nbsp;
 Greg is an excellent speaker, do make a point of seeing this session 
when it comes up on Parleys.&nbsp; Greg did an excellent job of 
explaining the gotchas of async IO programming, without any Responsive 
Manifesto hype.&nbsp; Very interestingly, he did admit that the his 
original objections to some of the Async Servlet API during the JSR-340 
expert group discussion proved to be unfounded and that he rather liked 
how the API turned out in the end.</p>&nbsp; <p><a href="https://community.oracle.com/servlet/JiveServlet/showImage/38-14343-149454/20140929-jcp-party.jpeg"><img __embedded_id="394" alt="JCP Party Picture" src="20141007_files/20140929-jcp-party.png" style="float:left;" width="180" height="207"></a> Next on the agenda was the Annual JCP Awards Party.&nbsp; The nominees and award winners are documented at &lt; <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://jcp.org/en/press/news/awards/2014award_nominees" rel="nofollow">https://jcp.org/en/press/news/awards/2014award_nominees</a>
 &gt;.&nbsp; There was some real competition in the events this year, 
but I'm happy to announce that Heather VanCura won the JCP 
Member/Participant of the year award.&nbsp; Speaking as a fellow Oracle 
employee, we all owe a debt of gratitude to Heather and her colleagues 
for continuing to demonstrate the value of the Java Community Process 
within a very shareholder-value (that is, short-term value) focused 
company.&nbsp; Standards pay dividends, but they tend to be long-term 
rather than short term.</p>&nbsp; <p>This year continues the tradition 
started last year of hosting the event at the Cityscape area on the top 
floor of the San Francisco Hilton.&nbsp; In the image at left you'll see
 Heather announcing the awards. You'll also notice some musical 
instruments.&nbsp; These were furnished courtesy of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jfrog.com/" rel="nofollow">JFrog</a> and played by a group fronted by <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/gbevin" rel="nofollow">Geert Bevin</a>.
 The group was a pick-up band composed of members of the Java Community 
and went by the name of, "The NullPointers".&nbsp; In addition to Geert,
 the band included <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/fguime" rel="nofollow">Freddy Guime</a> of the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://cjug.org/" rel="nofollow">Chicago Java Users Group</a>, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/frankgreco" rel="nofollow">Frank Greco</a> of the <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.javasig.com/" rel="nofollow">New York Java Users Group</a>, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/JavaFXpert" rel="nofollow">Jim Weaver</a>, Java Developer Advocate for Oracle, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/neuroph" rel="nofollow">Zoran Severac</a>, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/CesarHgt" rel="nofollow">Cesar Hernandez</a>, and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/matkar" rel="nofollow">Mattias Karlsson</a>, of <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/" rel="nofollow">JFokus</a>.&nbsp;
 I was going to sit-in on keyboard, but, as mentioned above, things 
blend together at JavaOne, and I had to leave the party early to present
 my JSF 2.3 BOF over at Moscone.&nbsp; Thankfully the band gave me 
another chance to sit in during their 2nd performance on 
Wednesday.&nbsp; It was sub-optimal to have to leave such a great event,
 but the community is more important than the community, in this case, 
so off to Moscone I went.</p>&nbsp; <p>This was the first year since the
 Oracle acquisition that any part of JavaOne has been held in 
Moscone.&nbsp; This year only the Mondy night BOFs were held there, but 
I'm hoping it's the beginning of a trend.&nbsp; This being a BOF, rather
 than a technical session, I incorporated content from two JSF Expert 
Group Members, <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/kito99" rel="nofollow">Kito Mann</a> and <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="https://twitter.com/ianhlavats" rel="nofollow">Ian Hlavats</a>.&nbsp; My slides are at <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/edburns/javaone-2014-bof4241-whats-next-for-jsf" rel="nofollow">slideshare</a>, as well as <a class="jive-link-external-small" href="http://www.slideshare.net/ianhlavats/jsf-23-presentation-integration-with-frontend-frameworks" rel="nofollow">Ian's</a>.
 The basic idea for JSF 2.3 is to provide a vehicle to attend to the fit
 and finish of the JSF spec, addressing JSF customer issues that have 
accrued over the years, and give the community a vehicle to propose, 
drive, and implement features that they feel are important, subject to 
final-cut from Manfred and I.&nbsp; The former category will include 
things like multi-component validation, Ajax method invocation, and 
better CDI integration.&nbsp; The latter category may include things 
like Kito's proposed JSON component rendering and Ian's proposed Twitter
 Bootstrap integration.&nbsp; Again, the emphasis in the latter category
 is for the community to do the heavy lifting, with oversight, veto 
authority and integration help from Oracle.</p>&nbsp; <p>That's not a bad first day!&nbsp; Booth duty, technical session, EG meeting, JCP Party, and BOF.</p> </div>
