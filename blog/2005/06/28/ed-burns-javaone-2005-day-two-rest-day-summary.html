    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>You
 can see my trend line for blog entries is going down. No excuses. Here 
is a summary post of the rest of day two at JavaOne 2005. This was the 
most interesting day for me, with many Faces talks and meetings planned.</p><span></span><p>The
 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the 
Wicket talk, where I ran into Howard. Here are the quick notes from 
Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework. Emphasizes fun, POJO centric, reuse, non-intrusive, safe, scalable, complete.</p><p>Sitting
 at this talk, I get the feeling there are two camps of web frameworks: 
1: non-big-corporate, open source, but benign despot technologies, 2: 
big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones. 
Even though JSF is very open, I feel people still see it as closed. Not 
true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the 
RAW HTML. Uses span with an id to hook up an HTML element to a

 EL? Is there something like a managed-bean framework? Pluggable 
rendering? Conversion? Portlet? Integration wit Struts? Database 
integration?</p><p>Questions</p><p>Portals? Not yet. State management always in session (no client option) Eelco says they're working with JetSpeed.</p><p>Faces has external navigation. Wicket does not.</p><p>Martijn
 makes a bold statement that Wicket will blow Faces out of the sky for 
AJAX support. We'll see Martijn! Competition is good!</p><p>Debugging? No, but they have the IDE.</p></div><span></span><p>After
 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

Wicket talk, where I ran into Howard. Here are the quick notes from 
Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 makes a bold statement that Wicket will blow Faces out of the sky for 
AJAX support. We'll see Martijn! Competition is good!</p><p>Debugging? No, but they have the IDE.</p></div><span></span><p>After
 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got

 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be.

responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited

The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger

work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt

Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface

 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn

Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three

 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union

 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

big-corporate non-open-source, standard based community developed ones.

true!</p><p>Demos: I18N, sortable tables, hello world.</p><p>Show the

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
 Dion's AJAX BOF, which was indeed well atended. Those two are fun 
speakrs, Ben especially.

 morning was packed. After the Amazon talk, I went straight to the

Wicket.</p><span></span><div style="margin-left: 2em;"><p>Miko talks about meeting Jon Locke.</p><p>Wicket, why its cool.</p><p>Talked about how many web frameworks there are.</p><p>What to look for in a framework.

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and

 Wicket, Howard and I went tried to grab a quick lunch but ended up 
chatting for a while about the difference between conferences like 
JavaOne and conferences like NoFluffJustStuff as analogous to the 
differences between big-corporate and non-big-corporate frameworks. 
Howard shared an analogy to the analogy regarding chaos theory. In the 
Mandlebrot set, all the interesting stuff happens at the interface 
between the really chaotic parts of the system, and the really stable 
parts of the system. That's where the fractal dragon appears. I like 
Howard, he's very agreeable, practical, and fun to hang out with.</p><span></span><p>After
 the unexpectedly long, and expectedly not so tasty lunch I was torn 
between Greg Murray and Tor Norbye's AJAX and Faces talk, and the FedEx 
Struts to Faces talk. Since I know Greg and Tor and actually contributed
 to some of the code they were using, I decided to go to the FedEx talk.
 I'm glad I did. The Yerba Buena theatre was packed. I think it's bigger
 than the Esplanade room. At today's morning keynote, John Gage 
mentioned some stats about the most attended session on Monday. I wonder
 which one it will be today? Kevin Hinners from FedEx laid out three 
strategies for migrating from Struts to Faces.</p><span></span><ol><li><p>Containment: Keep the Faces part of the app separate from the Struts part.</p></li><li><p>Rewrite: obvious.</p></li><li><p>Integration: using the Struts-Faces integration library.</p></li></ol><span></span><p>The
 most important thing about this talk for me was to see Faces adoption 
inside large enterprises like FedEx. After the FedEx talk, I had some 
time to kill so I prepared for tomorrow's Web Framework Smackdown. I 
collected a list of features that web frameworks have that I eventualy 
want to compile into a tabular format for comparison with the frameworks
 on the panel.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Portal Panel 
Discussion. I thought it would be important for me to be there, but it 
turned out to be a bit of a vendor pitch. The bright side was that I got
 some ideas on how I<strong>don't</strong> want the smackdown to be. 
This one was boring! I fell asleep. For the smackdown, I want to keep it
 lively and fun. I hope we succeed.</p><span></span><p>To that end, we 
had the technical rehearsal for the panel discussion tonight, followed 
by an intimate beer and pizza session in one of the meeting rooms where 
the panelists and moderator got to know each other and practice 
responses to questions. At TSSJS, Floyd told me that panel discussions 
work better when the participants know eachother, and there are limited 
surprises. Or, if there are surprises, they're not "total" surprises. 
The funniest thing about this little meeting was how I had to use 
Jason's marketing schwag carabiner as a bottle opener. Not an easy task!
 David Geary said, "I guess that's why you were the spec lead!". I felt 
some tension between the panelists, which is remarkable, really. I mean,
 we're all trying to solve the same problem, but there is indeed a real 
sense of rivalry. We'll see if it comes through for the audience 
tomorrow.</p><span></span><p>Next up was the Web Tier State of the Union
 BOF. This was the start of this years night of a thousand web-tier 
bofs. Not as well attended as I would have liked, but Adam Winer 
suggested we should have named it the AJAX web tier state of the union 
and then people would have shown up. Thanks to everyone who attended and
 asked questions!</p><span></span><p>After that I stayed through Ben and
