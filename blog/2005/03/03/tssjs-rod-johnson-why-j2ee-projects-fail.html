    <div class="jive-rendered-content"><p>Rod Johnson, why J2EE projects fail</p><span></span><pre>I. Enterprise Development is Hard

&nbsp; A. Why

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May integrate disparate systems

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard performance problems

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complex domains

&nbsp; B. hard to test

&nbsp; C. Hard to maintain

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software is never finished.&nbsp; Maintenance accounts for the bulk of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effort

II. J2EE is not a panacea

&nbsp; High failure rate

&nbsp; Good technology doesn't guarantee success

&nbsp; Bad technology does guarantee failure

III. It is possible to succeed in J2EE

&nbsp; Sound fundamentals

&nbsp; More mature app servers and tools

&nbsp; More mature developers.

&nbsp; Recounted anecdotes around impl problems a while ago.&nbsp; 

IV. General reasons for failure

&nbsp; 1. Poorly understood requirements

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing to do with J2EE

&nbsp; 2. Ideology (come back to this)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What constituted a pure J2EE system

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RDBs are evil

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Java is the center of the world

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J2EE is distributed, so everything is remote.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Technology is more important than the problem

&nbsp; 3. Lack of attention to performance

&nbsp; 4. Bad team dynamics

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; God-like architect

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too big a team

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overworked team (reactive v. strategic modes)

V. Technical reasons

&nbsp; Missed deliverables

&nbsp; Too much code

&nbsp; Take small example and extrapolate when it doesn't scale

VI. Requirements

&nbsp; There are less excuses for technical failure

&nbsp; He emphasized the importance of communication, more important than
&nbsp; technical.&nbsp; The importance of working with your manager.

VII. Requirements checklist

&nbsp; Do we know what the application should do?

&nbsp; How it should do it?

&nbsp; Whether does it does it?

&nbsp; Also mentioned the importance of testing.

VII. Solutions

&nbsp; Establish Continuall feedback

&nbsp; Listen to business

&nbsp; No waterfall usage

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J2EE is particularly ill suited to waterfall

&nbsp; Educate the business about the process.&nbsp; 

VIII. Ideology part II

&nbsp; Lots of it is kinda receding, he thinks this recession is one of the
&nbsp; reason that more J2EE projects are succeeding.

IX. Lack of attention to performance

&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the key failure causes

&nbsp;&nbsp; "First get it to work, then optimize"

&nbsp;&nbsp; Use architectural approaches that allows a degree architectural
&nbsp;&nbsp; refactoring.&nbsp; Such as?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loosely coupled layers (but be mindful of performance)

X. Team dynamics: the God-like architect

&nbsp; Politically astute, technically not.

&nbsp; Two varieties

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-coding: powerpoint, UML, (motivation: not enough), big picture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prescriptive framework builder: obsessed with the small and big
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; picture.&nbsp; Cares about controlling every aspect of the programmer's
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The myth of the code monkey: they exist to knock out code.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The framework builder believes that his main role is to prevent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developers from doing things.&nbsp; This is not how to develop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frameworks.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Successful Frameworks make best practice easy to do, but doesn't get
&nbsp;&nbsp; in the way of developers doing whatever they want.

XI. Team Dynamics: Consequences of prescriptive framework builder

&nbsp;&nbsp; Team morale plummets

&nbsp;&nbsp; People leave

XII. TD: Loss of communication

&nbsp; His view of the architect is that they can actually do any role on the
&nbsp; team.&nbsp; There must be mututal respect.&nbsp; Communication is essential to
&nbsp; success.&nbsp; He listed an example of bad communications

XIII. TD: too big a team

&nbsp; Scale the team up at a managable level.&nbsp; Do proof of concept first,
&nbsp; then grow the team.&nbsp; You have to know how to solve the problem before
&nbsp; you grow the team.

XIV. It's about working smart, not doing more work

&nbsp; Rod is interested in history

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Higher up decisions are very important.&nbsp; You can't succeeded with bad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; top down decisions.

&nbsp; Using frameworks allow working smarter

&nbsp; 1. Big problems

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too much code.&nbsp; Too much maintenance

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Failure to use appropriate frameworks, insufficient refactoring.

XV. TD: overwork

&nbsp; people work less effectively when they are tired and stressed.

&nbsp; Cosmetic overwork is really dangerous.&nbsp; Impress the client with activity.

XVI. Re-inventing the wheel

&nbsp; No excuse to build an in house framework from scratch.

&nbsp; Start from existing generic framework

&nbsp; Spring

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of extension points (he feels extension points are key for a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; successful framework).&nbsp; 

&nbsp; People apply high bar for accepting third party frameworks, have total
&nbsp; trust in their in-house framework.

XVII. Data access framework

&nbsp; Need to use one.&nbsp; Stock JDBC isn't enough.&nbsp; Never use straight JDBC.

&nbsp; Understandding how to judge OR mapping solution is appropriate.&nbsp; 

&nbsp; Understand core O/R mapping concepts

XVIII. Testing

&nbsp; Test first

&nbsp; Integration testing

IXX. Poor productivity

&nbsp; Lots of little hurdles

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow deploy-test cycles

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow build process

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow hardware

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow integration servers

&nbsp; MAJOR productivity hits.&nbsp; Increase the chance of failure

&nbsp; Design build process and infrastructure to minimize these delays.

&nbsp; Traditional J2EE development was laden with these little hurdles.

&nbsp; 

XX. Recommendations

&nbsp; Always begin with proof of concept, or executable vertical slice.&nbsp; All
&nbsp; modern methodologies recommend this.

&nbsp; Establish clear metrics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RUP (rational unified process) calls this the inception phase.

&nbsp; Don't trust architecture-or technologies, until you've tried it with
&nbsp; your needs.

&nbsp; Automate everything

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unit tests don't require container (due to dependency injection)

&nbsp; Choose good frameworks, that allow customization
