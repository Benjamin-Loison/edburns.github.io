<p>In my talk at 14:10 South Center Career Track, <a href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2019/florianopolis/trilha-carreiras-e-mentoria">Career Tips from Someone
Who Knows a Lot of Rockstar
Programmers</a>,
I will share some of the lessons I learned from the people I interviewed
for the <a href="/">Secrets of the Rockstar Programmers</a> book, and
also include some tips of my own.  Though I don’t claim to be a rockstar
programmer myself (or the newer term: “10x programmer”), I can honestly
say I know plenty of people that who are.</p>

<p>Working for big companies such as IBM, SGI, Sun, and Oracle, I’ve had
the chance to sample many useful corporate trainings.  Even the most
mundane of these, such as “Insider Trading”, offer at least one nugget
of novelty.  The corporate training I want to talk about here is one I
took at Sun at least twelve years ago.  It was called “Communicating
Your Value Add” and it was all about how to articulate your contribution
to your company at performance review time.  The class included a handout,
“Behavior/Performance-Based Questions” whose complete text I reproduce
below.  For discussion and reference, let’s call this <code class="highlighter-rouge">perf_handout</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s the basic idea.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get in the habit of producing written weekly status reports as simple
text files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annnotate some of the things you’ve done with <code class="highlighter-rouge">perf_handout.N</code> Where
<code class="highlighter-rouge">N</code> is the number of the corresponding list item below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When performance review time comes around, you can grep through your
status reports for <code class="highlighter-rouge">perf_handout</code> and your performance review
practically writes itself.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if I successfully introduced a new code review process, my
weekly status report would have a line like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>perf_handout.6: Designed and implemented a new code review process.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once you do this for a month or so, you’ll notice some areas you are
missing.  Try to fill those in, or if you can’t try to partner with
someone who you observe is able to do those things and learn from them.</p>

<p>Here now is the complete <code class="highlighter-rouge">perf_handout</code> content.</p>

<h3 id="behaviorperformance-based-questions">Behavior/Performance-Based Questions</h3>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>   A sampling of the types of questions that might be used to explore
   your level of accomplishment for specific skills are listed below.
   These questions provide a platform for *communcating your
   achievements* in skill areas such as leadership, decision-making,
   persuasiveness, coping, creativity, tolerance for ambiguity,
   organizational savvy, technical knowledge, and influencing.
   
   1. Describe a time when voicing your opinion was uncomfortable or
   could have had serious consequences, but you did it because you
   believed so strongly in the value of your perspective.
   
   2. What was the most creative idea you introduced on the job?  How
   did you persuade your superior?.
   
   3. Give me an example of the most complex project/assignment you have
   had, including your role and the outcome.
   
   4. Describe a situation at work when you had to make a decision and
   were uncertain about the outcome.
   
   5. What do you when you are communicating with someone and it becomes
   apparent that they don't understand what you are saying or vice
   versa?
   
   6. Describe a situation in which you developed a group into a strong
   working team?
   
   7. Communication and leadership go hand in hand.  Tell me about a
   time when your communication skills enabled you to influence the way
   others thought or acted, even in a very difficult situation.
   
   8. What important goals have you set in the past, and how were you
   able to work towards accomplishing them successfully?
   
   9. Describe how you delegate responsibility in your current job.
   
   10. Have you ever had to take over a leadership role unexpectedly?
   How did it work out?
   
   11. Sometimes it is important to disagree with others, particularly
   your boss, in order to prevent a mistake from being made.  Tell me
   about a time when you were willing to disagree with another person in
   order to build a positive outcome.
   
   12. Describe a time when you had to sell an idea to your boss or
   another authority figure.
   
   13. Give me an example taken from your experiences in report writing,
   preparation of memos, or general correspondence which illustrates
   the extent of your written communication skills.
   
   14. Building rapport can be a very challenging thing to do.  Give an
   example of a time when you were able to build rapport with an
   individual or group at work, even when the situation was difficult
   and the odds were against you.
   
   15. Solving problems requires more than good plans, it means taking
   action.  Give me an example of a time when you were able to take
   meaningful action in resolving a problem.
   
   16. In many problem situations, it is often tempting to jump to a
   conclusion to build a solution quickly.  Tell me about at time when
   you resisted this temptation and obtained all the facts about the
   problem before coming to a decision.
   
   17. Sometimes it is necessary to work in unsettled or rapidly
   changing circumstances.  When have you found yourself in this
   position?  Tell me exactly whay you did.
   
   18. Solving a problem often necessitates evalutation of alternative
   solutions. Give me an example of a time when you actively defined
   several solutions to a single problem using any tools such as
   research, brainstorming, or mathematics.
   
   19. Just about anybody can give a routine, standard answer to common
   problems; however, the payoff is often in the development of unique
   solutions to common problems.  Give me an example of one of your
   unique problem solutions.
   
   20. Describe an assigmnent that represented a unique challenge to
   you.
   
   21. Tell me about a time when you had to cope with strict deadlines
   or time demands.

   Communication and Teamwork, and Resourcefulness &amp; Creativity.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
   22. Based on established goals and objectives, for our group, what
   results did you achieve?  If a goal changed, how much progress did
   you make toward the revised goal?
   
   23. What additional contributions did you make?  Were there
   accoplishments that were definitely outstanding?
   
   24. What examples can you recall of instances in which you were
   responsive to your customer or successful in completing a quality
   job?
   
   25. What leadership and decision making abilities have you
   demonstrated?
   
   26. Give me an example of a major decision you've made and the

   functional expertise.
   
   31. Tell me about what measures you have taken to ensure that your
   skills are state-of-the-art.
   
   32. Give me an example of an effective presentation you have made.
   
   33. Give me an example of how cooperative interaction with other
   members of the Sun team have been a part of your work.

   on your "being-there" time after time, project after project.
   
   35. Give me an example of when you used strategic thinking in moving
   toward achieving a goal.
