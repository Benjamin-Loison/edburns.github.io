    <p>It’s still unreal to me that I’m writing this, but here it is.  After
over 22 years at Oracle (13 at Sun), I’m moving on to another company.
In my time at Oracle, I have had a chance to help shape technologies
that have had a positive impact on our industry and lives.</p>

<p>I’m not into bragging, humble or otherwise, but I do want to call out a
few projects with which I am especially thankful to have been involved.
I am not going to name names for fear of leaving someone out, but I am
deeply thankful for all my friends who have helped me over the years.</p>

<h2 id="anything-to-do-with-jcp">Anything to do with JCP</h2>

<p>I’m very glad for my chance to contribute to and validate the Java
Community Process (<a href="https://jcp.org/">JCP</a>) as a demonstrably successful way to allow a broad
spectrum of contributors to practically influence the Java they use in
their own jobs.  Oracle practices a culture of diversity, and this is
one area where the practice was apparent.</p>

<p>The most rewarding part of my career so far was working on JSF as part
of the JCP.  The technology we built, and the community we built around
it, is very special.  There have been many highpoints but one that
sticks out for me personally was the gathering at my house after
the JSFSummit in December 2008 in Orlando.</p>

<p>There are several other JCP specs that I’ve had the chance to work on,
including Servlet and Bean Validation.  Those have been very rewarding
as well.</p>

<h2 id="conference-speaking">Conference Speaking</h2>

<p>I had my first taste of conference speaking at JavaOne 2002, and my
<a href="https://javaserverfaces.github.io/presentations/w-jax-keynote-de-en.pdf">first keynote opportunity</a>
in 2005.  Since then I’ve been very blessed to continue speaking.</p>

<h2 id="book-opportunities">Book Opportunities</h2>

<p>I’m very grateful for the chance to co-author several books about Java
technologies.  Those opportunities were possible thanks to the awesome
community around Java.</p>

<h2 id="nullpointers">NullPointers</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever seen my Rockstar talk, you know about my fondness for
Buckaroo Banzai and his part-time rockstar ways.  Having a chance to act
that out during some fun times at JavaOne, GoTo, and DevNexus was the
fulfillment of a career dream.</p>

<h2 id="netscape-6-and-oji">Netscape 6 and OJI</h2>

<p>Back in the heady days of the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/24/aolnetjava.idg/index.html?_s=PM:TECH">Sun-Netscape-AOL
Alliance</a>,
I was part of a small group of people from Sun that went into the client
side of that deal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AOL and Sun together will develop the next version of Netscape’s
Navigator and Communicator software clients and AOL will use Java in
its e-commerce offerings, the company said.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave me a first hand look at the birth of JavaScript and the
management decisions around Java in the browser that eventually lead to
the rise and fall of Applet, JavaFX, and even Java on the desktop.</p>

<h2 id="creating-opportunities">Creating Opportunities</h2>

<p>Finally, I’m very thankful to work on technologies that create
opportunities for others to create things.  Those of us who work on
programming platforms can honestly say that we allow individuals and
entrepeneurs to create their own businesses (often employing many
people, sometimes paying a very good wage) that create solutions for
<em>their</em> customers.  This position in at a lower-level of the value chain
is a great place to be.</p>

<p>Oracle was and is a great place to work, and they have trusted me to
contribute in the above areas and several others.  In return, I have
deep trust in my management chain at Oracle.  I have nothing but good
things to say about working there.</p>
