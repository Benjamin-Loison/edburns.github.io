Back in the Fall of 1999 my friend Chris turned me on to MAME.
Naturally this re-kindled my interest in classic games and now I read
rec.games.video.classic every day.  It was in rgvc that I heard of the
magical event that is the <A HREF="http://www.cgexpo.com/">Classic
Gaming Expo</A>.  I decided to use my <A
HREF="http://bushoncrack.com/">tax refund</A> to prop up the Las Vegas
economy and bought a ticket to the show.  Here's my account of my first
time at CGE!

</P>

<H3>Day 1</H3>

<P>

After purchasing my nicely laminated ticket, I entered the hall.  It was
quite a moment for me.  The room opened up into a vast array of free
play games set up on the perimiter, and vendors set up in the middle,
with the very nifty analog sounds of Seth Sternberger's 8 bit weapon.  I
toured the vendor hall until the first keynote speech.  I really wish
the show organizers had been more up front with the keynote schedule.
The room where the keynotes were to be held wasn't signed very well, but
no matter, it was easy to figure out.

</P>

<P>

For me, the main attraction was the keynote speakers.  The work these
people did back in the day got me started into computers.  I remember
being a kid, playing the games, and wondering what the people that made
these games were like.  Getting to meet some of the top programmers
was a realization of a childhood dream.

</P>

The first session was given by Steve Woita, <A
HREF="http://www.robfulop.com/">Rob Fulop</A>, <A
HREF="http://polaro.com/">Bob Polaro</A> and John Seghers.  You can read
the bios on the cge web page.  I'll just give some notable data.  I was
amazed at how young these guys looked, especially Steve Woita.  Rob
Fulop's current venture is called pfmagic.  It turns out the background
star field in his game, Demon Attack, was discovered by accident while
he was programming the game.  He put a comment in the code "Pure Fucking
Magic".  Hence the name of his new venture.  Rob mentioned and the other
panelists concurred, that much of the quality in the old games was due
to exploiting bugs and other oddities in the 2600 hardware.  I chatted
with Rob after the panel and together we lamented the shift in game
design from re-playable to consumable games.  Rob offered that one
reason for this shift is that the original home games were heavily
inspired by coin-ops, which had a business model based on
re-playability, whereas today's business model is based on causing the
consumer to want to buy more games, rather than re-playing the same one
again and again.  Another interesting tidbit is that the voice saying
Quadrun in the game Quadrun is Steve Woita's.  The panelists all agreed
that classic game emulators were generally preferable to the games never
being playable again.

The next panel was the arcade programmers.  Jamie Fenton's talk was
really interesting.  I appreciated her use of video and slides in
talking about the development of the game Ms. Gorf.  The game never
shipped, but it had some nifty hardware design for its time.  It used
two Z80 processors, with clearly delineated responsibilites for each.  I
wish I remembered what each was used for.  She said the idea was born
from the observation that one particular aspect of running the game
ended up taking up a large chunk of the CPU cycles, so why not farm off
that aspect to another CPU?  She showed video of the game in
development, which was narrated by her twin brother Jay Fenton.  Franz
Lanzinger mentioned how important it was to be an ace player of arcade
games, as well as designing them.  Later on, the Activision guys also
emphasized the hyper competitive nature of their lot when it came to
playing the games.  Susan McBride spoke about how graphic design people
came to be involved in game creation.  She mentioned some of the early
tools used to create the graphics, but spoke fondly of the day when they
did the graphics coding by hand.  Susan was very friendly and I saw her
hanging out for the rest of the conference.

Following the arcade programmers, I went out to the vendor area, played
a little circus, and cruised the vendors.  I wasn't too happy with the
prices I saw.  This being by first classic gaming show, I wasn't sure
what kind of prices to expect, so I was expecting optimistically.  I was
lookinf for some 2600, driving controllers but no-one had any.  I bought
some after the show from <A
HREF="http://www.atari2600.com/">http://www.atari2600.com/</A>, however.
I love Carla Meninsky's <A
HREF="http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&SQL=GIH|||||8475">Indy
500</A>.  At this point, I took the time to play a little warlords on
the Dreamcast at the <A
HREF="http://www.infogrames.com/corp_pressreleases.php?op=story&sid=81">Infogrames
booth</A>.  Their Atari Anniversary Edition had the arcade Warlords,
which I had never played before.  It was fun to play four players with
other conference attendees.
