* Introduce yourself

* Start out with late Climber 5 feedback

# Climber 5

This is the week of Strudders inspiration, I started posting to the
official podcast forum and I am including my son as a special guest.  I
hope he becomes a regular.

We had a ton of fun playing Climber 5.  He was better at it than I was.
Some things I liked about this.

* No flicker

* Appropriate ramp up of difficulty

* Thunk sound when you press the button to reverse the girders

* I could have done with some more sounds

* The butterflies around your head when you die.  As Ferg said, better
  than the sitting down in Outlaw, but when you think about the fact
  that these two games have copyright dates that are 28 years apart, on
  the same hardware, you'd expect that.
  
  Also, Mr. Debro is in the company of greats with an Outlaw comparison,
  since that game was authored by none other than David Crane.
  
* I loved the colors of the more advanced levels.  Getting to see the
  exotic high level colors still excites me.  I remember loving the
  colors on the high levels of 2600 Dig Dug.

Here is some audio from Owen and I playing the game.

# Now on to Fireball

* Audio clip of Pitbull Fireball

* Gladness at being able to play Supercharger games on my phone setup

* Edit audio from session with Owen.
