    <h1>Tunnels of Doom: An Interview with Kevin Kenney, Part II</h1>

<H2><A NAME="tod_questions">Part II:</A> Tunnels of Doom and Programmer Questions</H2>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Where did you get the idea for the game? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> ToD?  D&D in college, Alkabeth, Wizardry, Infocom... The
other games [Hunt the Wumpus, A-Maze-Ing] were items that were partially
completed, and had been put on the shelf: I pulled them off the shelf
and came up with the ways to make them into viable stand-alone products.
(A-maze-ing, Hunt the Wumpus, and Blasto originally were planned to be
combined as a single 6K cartridge, without most of each game's
features.)
</P>


<P><I><B>EB:</B> Can you take us through the whole process of building
Tunnels of Doom?  How many people worked on it?  Was ToD the first game
to use a 3D gaming display, as in Quake?  How much time from conception
to shipping was required for Tunnels of Doom?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Total time: 18 months, mainly by me (except for testing).
Alkabeth or Wizardry on the Apple or Tandy might have been there with
vector-style graphics first, but I colored in the walls and randomly
built the dungeon.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> So you were working full time on ToD during that time?
</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B>I'm unsure.  There we're probably firefights and minor
tasks throughout the period, and I think it overlapped my work with
TIRK. [See below]
 </P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What do you feel is the reason it took that long? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> I was designing it as well as programming it, shooting
high, and trying to get the things I wanted into it.  I think it took
over a month to design and balance the maze digging routines.  Then
there was extensive testing and review by the artistic types in Dallas.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Yeah, the production design of ToD is really great.
Did you know it would take that long when you started?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Close.  At the start, I probably expected six months, but
as my desired features list grew, so did the project.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Ah, the creepy feature creature strikes again!  Did you
do the game in a breadth first or depth first implementation?  That is,
did you start out with a little bit of bootstrapping to make the basic
app runnable, and then add features; or did you code for a long time,
and *then* run the game?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> By your definitions, I've always worked 'breadth first'
I'd argue the term.  Development was one section at a time: Data
structures (continually expanding), base graphics, dungeon digger, '3D'
graphics engine & movement, dungeon stocker, game save/load, combat,
'magic' items, graphics effects.  Expansion, polishing, and tweaking of
'completed' sections continued as needed.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> How much does time does each aspect of the game
take?</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Polishing and balancing, in parallel to testing, takes the
largest chunk.  Hard to find bugs seem to take forever.  The graphics
and music back then were simple enough to not take particularly long.
</P>


<P><I><B>EB:</B> Did you do your own scheduling and milestone setting
for the development of the game?  If so, do you remember what were some
of the milestones </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> The milestones were the section beaks above, and I did
have scheduling control (better termed 'targeting').  The only drop-dead
dates were for CES's, and the school (for educational products) and Xmas
shopping starts.  Though I'm a poor scheduler (too optimistic), I make
up for it by being able to lower the targets for products as a drop-dead
date approaches, in order to provide a good salable product when
desired.  ToD was a bit of an exception to this, since making it fit in
30k took a bit of work.  Some things that we're locked into it to get it
out were the requirement for precisely two stairwells between floors,
and hand combat damage being locked in at 2 points.
</P>

<P>(CES: Consumer Electronics show, in Vegas in Jan, Chicago in June,
occurring to this day.  Before E3, they included video game systems.  An
unrelated CES story: The year before I got to TI, CES still had adult
video vendors on the same floor as the mainstream exhibits.  (They later
went to a separate hall, and then a separate show.)  The TI booth had
access problems (though a captive audience for demos) due to an
adjoining booth having signings by Marilyn Chambers's)
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Who came up with the default names of the characters:
Forrestal Grimm, Eric Seablade, and Mauve d'Orm Mul mean?  Are there any
stories behind these names?  What does Mauve d'Orm Mul mean anyway?
</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B>Marketing in Dallas I believe, with the names
representative of the characters' colors.  Mauve = purple.
 </P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Who composed the <A HREF="sounds/">excellent music</A>?
</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> <A NAME="TOD_MUSIC">I'm not sure</A>.  They had a musician
on staff in Dallas [Probably Hank Mishkoff, see <A HREF="hank_mishkoff_interview.html">interview</A>], who probably did the main theme, which I may have
tweaked.  There's one note we didn't agree on in the theme: he won.  I
did most of the music for the smaller games, including the slowly
speeding theme for The Attack.  Being unschooled in such things, my
attempts at sound effects sometimes got comical.  I tried an attenuating
tone for an implosion song for the eggs hatching in The Attack, and
ended up with Christmas chimes...
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> The TI produced games had excellent documentation.  I
even recall seeing some marketing material from TI that listed quality
documentation as a selling point.  How much contact did you as the game
author have with the people who wrote the manuals for your games?
</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> A reasonable amount.  They too were in Dallas, but spent
time with me to learn the game, and then always sent the manuals my way
for revision, and usually took whatever suggestions I had.
</P>

</TABLE>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> When I was preparing the banner for the title page of
this site, I got up close and personal with your title screen for ToD.
Getting down to a pixel level, I could see your graphics talents in each
of the letters.  My favorite is the S.  I also like the F.  Are there
any stories behind the title letters or the title screen?  </I></P>


<P><B>KK:</B> The F was a nod to Wumpus, and I think I was running out
of characters, which led to the repetitive T.  The Outer Limits
(original series) episode <A HREF="http://www.homevideos.com/outerlimits/olr14.htm">'The Zanti Misfits'</A> may have inspired the L.
The rest were just the sort of things to be found in the dungeon.
</P>

<P>A technical Graphics note, of possible use to the emulator writers,
and a good example of thinking flexibly.  The 99/4a had a 'bitmapped'
graphics mode, that used 3 banks of 256 8x8 characters, one for each
third of the screen (vertically).  A similarly-sized set of banks of
color data allowed you to have 2 colors per line of a character instead
of 2 colors per character. Using this mode used up most of the space
used for data by most programs, including ToD.  The idea was to use each
character once on the screen, sequentially.  Sega realized that if you
loaded each bank with the same characters, you could use any character
anywhere on the screen (as you would in a non-bitmapped game) and get
the extra colors for a relatively minor increase in program space.  They
used this approach for Zaxxon.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Does Tunnels of Doom have any Easter eggs or secrets?
If so, how does the player expose them?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Nope.  No room for eggs there.  Near the end, I was
limiting game features to make it all fit in 30K.  (+15K database)
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What was your development environment back then? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Mainframe via monochrome terminals downloading into
water-heater sized emulators.  The emulators had displays for viewing
memory and setting breakpoints manually.  An interpreted in-house
language called GPL was used, though pure assembly was being phased in
for the latter arcade games.
 </P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What about code re-use?  Did the programmers share
code?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Libraries were developed from people’s code, and saw some
reuse.  Then again, GPL gave us a lot of our standard needs.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Did you use a source code control system?  If so, how
was it to use?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> 	Yes, on the mainframe.  It wasn’t particularly onerous.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What was your debugging process?  Did you have a source
level debugger?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Originally, a keypad on the water heater to look at the
current address and view or modify memory locations, shown via 7-segment
LEDs.  A source debugger was developed during my time there, but it took
a bit of preparation, so for simpler bugs the keypad/LED was
occasionally used. </P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What makes a good video game for you? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Fun, and play balance.  A reasonable learning curve
allowing you to get fairly far into a game.  The ability to save
frequently.</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What do you think of today's home video games? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> I'm mainly into 3D shooters, survival horror, and some
RPG.  The recent game I play most: Diablo II with LoD.  An earlier game
I still play: Empire Deluxe.  I don't have the time for the longer RPGs,
or games that only let you save if you complete a mission.  I never got
into sports or real-time strategy titles.  Loved Serious Sam.</P>

<P>There's a lot of good stuff in today's, but too often the rush to the
door shows.  (Pool of Radiance, anyone?)  I probably buy 5x the amount
of games I'll ever get around to playing.  (Also books, DVD's, board
games, etc.)  I'm still a solitary player: too many sharks online,
though I was in the Diablo II beta.</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What are you doing now?  Are you working on any games
now?</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> I went from chemical instrumentation, to modem and audio
drivers for Windows at Rockwell, to PC diagnostics, to embedded systems
now, with some management duties along the way.  There's enough good,
young, and cheaper game programmer's out there now, there's little way
for me to get back into it.  Then there's the boom/bust cycles, the way
most of the work is in translation between systems, and the frequent
manager that doesn't have a clue.  I could see myself as a manager, or
going core and utility algorithms, though I'd also like to get back into
scientific programming someday.</P>

<P>Also, I finally got to apologize to Steve Jackson at an E3 a couple
of years ago.  You see, I mentioned to my boss one day that there was
this non-computer game already called Car Wars</P>

<P>(To those that may not know, for years all the items for Steve Jackson's
Games tabletop Car Wars products had to have a disclaimer on them about
not being associated with out product because of this.)</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Did you work on TI Car Wars? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> This was another game by the guy that did Munch Man and TI
Invaders (and Parsec). [Jim Dramis] I think my role was limited to
testing and possibly making suggestions. </P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> I'm going to add a section on <A HREF="emulation.html">how to use
MESS to play ToD on your PC</A>.  How do you feel about emulators
for classic games?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> I'm generally anti-piracy, but have few problems
personally if a game's out of print.
