    <h1>Tunnels of Doom: An Interview with Kevin Kenney</h1>

<P>Kevin Kenney is a veteran computer programmer, being in the biz since
the late '70s.  He's produced titles on a variety of classic and
contemporary platforms including: TI-99/4A, Commodore 64, Commodore
Vic-20, Apple ][, Sigma 9, and mainframe computers.  Kevin graciously
accepted my invitation for conducting an interview in the winter
of 2002.</P>

<H2><A NAME="general_questions">Part I:</A> Background and General
Information</H2>

<P><I><B>Ed Burns:</B> Can you give me some resume details?  Where did you go
to school, what kind of computer training did you have, how did you come
to work at TI?  </I></P>

<P><B>Kevin Kenney:</B> I was an egghead in high school, testing quite
high on the mathematics side.  I got into Chemistry by being a
Mr. Wizard fan as a kid.  As an undergraduate in college, I got into
computers, and ended up doing Computer-Aided Instruction programs for
the colleges of Chemistry, Biology, and Physics; even ending up as a
Teaching Assistant for some Engineering Chemistry courses (for Dr. Earl
Krakower, as well as Terrence Morrill).  Took a few computer classes
along the way, sometimes telling new professors the differences between
the text and the system in use, and having some of my computing
requirements waived. </P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Very impressive that RIT even <B>had</B> computing
requirements back then!</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> (Off topic: In high school & early college, I was into
probability, and wondered the chance of landing on Boardwalk on any
given circuit of a Monopoly board (minus card effects, etc.).  One of my
earliest programming projects was to find out, and I devised the formula
to give the number of ways to role a given number on X Y-sided dice, for
any X and Y.  Plugging this into a large HP desktop programmable
calculator, I came up with the common sense result: since the average
roll is 7, the chance to hit a space tends towards 1/7th as the number
of spaces away increases.  I might have published this, but lacked the
mathematical notation experience to properly write out the formula.)
</P>

<P>A previous alum (Brad) checked with the professors he had had at RIT
to see if anyone interesting was about to graduate, and I was pointed
out.  TI was my first interview, and I got an offer during the
interview.  Given the choice of programming games or cleaning test
tubes...
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> [Laughs out loud] Was Brad a current TI employee?  Did
he work on games as well?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B>I believe Brad was in systems or &quot;serious&quot;
programming: I don't remember him doing any games.  (Off topic: I
remember one of my supervisors trying to get me to move to TI Dallas,
saying I'd find systems programming similar to games programming...)
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> HA!  It certainly seems like a more stable job choice,
but the work seems very different.  Can you remember some of the other
people you worked with at TI?</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> (Ground rule: I'm hideous with names - I can remember
faces, personalities, and events, but few names.  Prepping for this
interview, I found an office birthday party card.  Some of the names on
the card, and what I think I remember about them follow.  (My apologies
to all if I get names wrong (including spelling errors) and/or connected
to memories incorrectly.  Apologies also to those I wanted to mention,
but couldn't remember the names of.)) [Editor's note: you can tell he's a programmer with the correctly nested parens.  I wonder if he's done any LISP?]
</P>

<P>The (partial) roster (as far as I can make them out from the card):  
</P>

	<UL>

	  <LI><P>Don Bynum - manager - outgoing, affable, stereotypic
	  friendly Texan type.  Wonderful guy.  </P></LI>


	  <LI><P>Bob Hensler (spelling?) - somewhat older gent, did
	  Alpine Climber. </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Carolyn Lee - educational/speech programmer.  I think
	  she was the one still working on a project the morning of the
	  day she had a kid...  (conflicting deadlines)
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Donna - educational programmer.  I still remember her
	  reaction to my mentioning Kirk Douglas' nude scene in Saturn
	  V...  (a la "Kirk... Douglas...???  THE Kirk Douglas?")
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Sue Hensley - manager of testing.  Friendly, but with
	  the strength of personality to get the job done well.
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Jim Dramis - another good game programmer, more
	  politically correct, who did may of the later games, as
	  mentioned below.  </P></LI>

    </UL>

<P>Others from the card, I'm either less sure of the tasks of, or
otherwise have no stories for I sure of enough to relate:
</P>

	<UL>

	  <LI><P>Dean Powell
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Robert Herd - I did have a relatively good friend there, unfortunately with a common-enough name to make it hard to remember.  This may have been him.)
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Jim Ng
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Mari Forseth
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Susan Powell
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Mary Lopez
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Susan Gum
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Terry Spacek
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Bobby Mathers
	  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>John Acker (If I've got Jim Dramis wrong elsewhere,
	  John is whom I may have confused him with.)  </P></LI>

	  <LI><P>Jeanette, Allan, Roy, Debbie
	  </P></LI>

	</UL>

<P>Editor's note: That's a treasure trove of names above.  Jim Dramis
worked on with Paul Urbanus on the TI Game Parsec.  You might notice
some obvious self references in the game: the initials JED and URB in
the landscape, and the fact that two of the enemy ship types are called
Dramite and Urbite.  You can find game credits for many of these names
at James Hague's most excellent <A
HREF="http://dadgum.com/giantlist/list.html">Giant List of Classic Game
Programmers</A> [1].
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> How did you get into programming games?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> See above.  I had been a member of the board Wargaming
club, had probably been the first D&D dungeonmaster (brown-box days),
and had translated Colossal Cave to run on the school's Sigma 9.  So I
was into games enough to make the transition.</P>

</B></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What was it like working at TI?  What was the hacker
culture there?  Were programmers treated well there?  Stock options?
Free Soda?  Free arcade machines?  Were they full time TI employees, or
contractors.  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> None of the above.  The closest thing to a hacker culture
were the "I didn't work on the 99/4" buttons subversively distributed.
Cubicle city, going from 4 programmers in a cube to tiny one-person
cubes.  All full-time (though see below).
</P>

<P>A story.  I was into Yoga and foreign films in college, and continued
both pursuits in Lubbock.  Yoga was at the YWCA, which a female
instructor that also taught at Texas Tech.  One day while leaving the
class, she was telling me about a film series at the college, as she met
her husband.  The introduction went something like:
</P>

	<UL>

<P>She: This is Kevin.  He works out at TI.</P>
<P>He: Oh, which division?</P>
<P>Me: Home computers.</P>
<P>He: Oh, MY division.  (It was Pete Bonsfield.)</P>

	</UL>

<P>A couple of days later he called a staff meeting to meet all the new
hires, and relate, as a joke, how he had met me while I was discussing
French films with his wife...
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> According to the <A
HREF="http://www.homecomputercentral.com/TImeline/default.html">TI
Timeline</A> [2], TI made the mistake of laying you off right after you
finished ToD.  Is this true?  Is there any interesting story there?  Was
this part of a round of layoffs, or was it a bone-headed management
decision?  </I></P>

</TD></TR> <TR><TD> <B>Above: The sketch of the liberal Mr. Kenney,
expressing his love for New York and Z-80's.  </B></TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P><B>KK:</B> The timeline's correct.  One reason was that ToD took over
a year to program.  Another may have been my liberal political bent.  (I
still have a sarcastic sketch someone made of me as a left-wing radical
hippie type.)  Then I had also backgammoned my supervisor at the
previous Christmas office party. Mine was part of a larger layoff.  TI
did then contract with me to do additional databases for ToD, and only
one (with a 'spy' motif: find blueprints instead of gems) had been
completed but never released.  (My 99/4 gave up the ghost a ways back,
and during some space-constrained move I got rid of my copies.  Perhaps
if I had seen emulators coming...) My working title was 'Spy Guy'.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Was it really conservative at TI, and in Lubbock in the
early eighties?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> As a college town, not really.  The town was dry, and thus
ringed with liquor stores (and non-safe-and-sane fireworks booths).
There was probably more flak for my being a Yankee instead of a
Democrat.
</P>

<P>Conservatism was the rule in the games though.  I had to battle to
get the deaths left in Wumpus, especially flashing the screen to pure
red should you stumble into the Wumpus's lair.  Way too shocking for
some.  (Trivia: Did you notice the French translation for 'Slime' when
you fell in a pit was 'Mousse'?)
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> It's hard to believe they balked at the goriness of
Wumpus.  What would they have thought of Quake?  How stodgy!  What was
the dress code at TI?  Did you have to wear a tie?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> The facility was a manufacturing one, so jeans to business
casual was the rule.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Was there a camaraderie among all the programmers?
</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> A fair degree.  I remember us all getting along regardless
of politics.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Did you or any of your programming compatriots ever
wish they were in Silicon Valley?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Not I.  Too much competition.  After TI, I worked for a
toy consultation firm during the Atari 2600 boom/bust cycle, and did a
little work for Epyx, that gave me a taste of the culture there.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B>Regarding the boom bust cycle, what was your personal
experience with the great video game crash in the early eighties?
</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Watched it at the consulting firm mentioned above, which
had enough other projects to see me through.  I then got into scientific
programming: chemical instrumentation control and analysis.  Still doing
serious stuff, still playing games on the side.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What is the complete list of games for which you were
the primary author?</I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> Tunnels of Doom, Hunt the Wumpus, A-Maze-ing; though the
latter two were picked up from elsewhere and greatly expanded on.  After
TI, I did programming or design on some smaller stuff for various
consoles such as Hot Wheels, Congo Bongo (non-arcade), and one arcade
machine for Mylstar called Stamp Them Ants, that never saw wide release,
as Mylstar went under.  The commercial for VCS Congo Bongo featured
footage of the game as I played it (offscreen).  (My closest brush with
fame.) These latter games were for A. Eddy Goldfarb & Associates,
'creators to the toy industry', who designed many of the top products
(toys, dolls, games) for many game companies.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Non-primary author? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> I did a lot of work on The Attack, including
play-balancing, its theme song and sound effects.  Suggestions for
others.  Spent some time doing input routines for TIRK.
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> What is TIRK? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> 	Tax & Investment Record Keeping.</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> Did you make any contributions to other titles? </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> I tested and made suggestions on a lot of the game titles,
probably having the most effect on our Pac-Man and Space Invaders
rip-offs.  (Both primarily programmed by the same guy, I think Jim
Dramis. He gets the vast majority of the credit, including for
occasionally listening to me.  He was our other 'best' game programmer,
and did surpass me, partially due to working in assembly instead of
GPL.)
</P>

<P><I><B>EB:</B> For what platform did you work on Congo Bongo?  How was
it different programming that platform from working on the TI?  </I></P>

<P><B>KK:</B> C-64, Vic-20(?).  A VCS version was done by another
company that worked with Goldfarb's. Though I don't remember doing any
significant programming on Congo-Bongo, I did do the original screen
translations (when Sega's brass saw the same screens on all the systems,
we we're in), and some light algorithm, and balancing stuff.
 </P>

<P>All the home-system games were developed on Apple ]['s.  Prom-burning
without emulators, so you had to add your own debugging code.
</P>
