SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1994 SEP 8 (NB) -- IBM has
announced its planned Internet offering which is to be included in
the new version of OS/2, called Warp. While the name of this new
operating system (OS) may not be Warp in the final version, IBM
made it clear that the Internet offering includes everything from
file transfer protocol (FTP) to a World Wide Web browser, and one
button registration and log-on.

A number of analysts previously suggested IBM would offer an
Internet utility for file and electronic-mail management. To the
surprise of many, IBM's latest OS/2, which is still on schedule
for its October release, will forego Mosaic and any of its enhanced
versions for its own Web browser, WebExplorer. This browser will
be available after the initial release of Warp.

OS/2 users of the new operating system will have one of the most
complete Internet access packages available. As well as access to
gopher, telnet, FTP, e-mail, the Web and newsgroups, IBM will
provide one-button registration and sign-on capabilities to its
own IBM Global Network, which is managed by Advantis. The
management group is a partnership formed by IBM and Sears,
Roebuck.

Wally Casey, IBM's director of marketing, told Newsbytes, "With this
operating system, we want to deliver one package which would include
a 32-bit operating system and a bonus pack of full applications. After
careful consideration, we concluded Internet access was essential to
rounding-out a full and ready-to-use system."

Beyond offering an interface and access to the "Net," IBM says it will
also provide extensive help for navigating the complex network.
Novice users will have a schoolhouse to check-in to and IBM promises
to update users on new sites, activities, and changes on the Internet.

Casey continued, "While we want to offer our users the most complete
Internet package possible, we do not intend to rule out other providers.
Any user of the new operating system will be able to connect to other
Internet service provider. Advantis will offer worldwide service, but
there may be instances where a local provider may be a better
connection to an individual user."

The rates for accessing Advantis were not released, but Casey assured
the conference attendees that it would offer comparable rates to other
providers. He suggested a packet of hours would be offered for a
monthly rate, after which hourly charges would prevail.

Warp's Internet e-mail system is based on IBM's Ultimail which sends
and receives mail through all gateway online providers and allows for
bit-mapped annotated documents.

A Newsreader which will search and update a user's favorite newsgroups
is included. Represented by a NewsReader icon, this service allows users
to select the newsgroups that interests them and have them updated
daily.

IBM does not release predictions about the number of copies it expects
to deliver in the first issue of Warp, but Casey said, "You will see a very
strong advertising campaign. We plan to get the word out to everyone
that IBM is offering a full 32-bit, ready-to-use operating system with a
full set of standard applications."

Prices for the new OS have not been released, but indications point to a
price somewhere in the range of $100. Casey said, "This new version of
OS/2, including the bonus pack of applications and Internet package will
cost less than the standard boxed software/book offerings of other
Internet packages." Newsbytes research shows these products being
offered at a suggested retail price of $129.

Warp will allow applications written for OS/2, Windows 3.1 and 3.11,
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11 and DOS to run on the same
desktop. Earlier versions of OS/2 did not address the four megabyte
(MB) RAM market. One of the main targets for Warp is the 4MB user
base in the desktop environment. IBM also plans to target network
users.
