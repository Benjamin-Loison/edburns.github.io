# OBJECTIVE

Put my experience and education to work in a creatively challenging
organization dedicated to producing world-class software through
efficient application of software engineering practices.

# EXPERIENCE

I have developed my career with proven distinctions in three related
core competencies: software development, technical writer, and
training/developer relations.  

# Software Development

## Oracle America, Inc.

### 2017-06 — present, Consulting Member of the Technical Staff, Santa Clara, CA

#### Cloud Collections State Service
* Team member working on upcoming addition to Oracle's public cloud: tentatively called Cloud Collections State Service. This technology brings the power of Oracle Coherence to the Oracle public cloud. Cloud Collections is delivered as Kubernetes-orchestrated Docker containers and has gRPC enabled language bindings for Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Swift.
* On the Cloud Collections team, I work in development on the Java, JavaScript, and Go clients and also as a technical writer.

### 2016-07 — 2017-05, Consulting Member of the Technical Staff, Santa Clara, CA

#### Etcd on Oracle Coherence
* I worked on a project to build an Etcd implementation on top of Oracle Coherence, a high performance distributed key/value store.

#### Jakarta EE
* Help to transition JavaServer Faces (JSF) to the Eclipse Foundation for continued evolution by the community.
* Mentor Beijing team responsible for continued maintenance of Oracle's JSF implementation before and after transition to Eclipse.

### 2015-09 — 2016-06, Consulting Member of the Technical Staff, Santa Clara, CA

#### Microservices Development Project
* At the dawn of the microservices boom, I worked on a project to create a successor to Java EE for the microservices world. This service would be Java powered, Docker based, and cloud ready. It was built on Apache Mesos/Marathon and featured support for many microservices best practices, including: blue-green deployments, canary testing, circuit breakers, service regiestires, and API discovery.

### 2013-06 — 2015-08, Consulting Member of the Technical Staff, Santa Clara, CA

#### Java EE 8
* Co-Specification Lead for Java Servlet 4.0
* Co-Specification Lead for JSF 2.3

### 2010-08 — 2013-05, Consulting Member of the Technical Staff, Santa Clara, CA

#### Java EE 7
* Co-Specification Lead for JSF 2.2

## Sun Microsystems, Inc.

### 2002-10 — 2010-07, Senior Staff Engineer, Santa Clara, CA

#### Java EE 6
* Specification lead for JSF 2.0.
* Was instrumental in promoting JSF by writing books, teaching classes and giving frequent conference presentations.
* Help lead a team of industry experts from leading companies such as IBM, BEA, Sun, and Oracle in developing the specification for JSF.
* Pioneered and patented techniques for using JSF and AJAX together (US 8,533,291 B1, US 7,788,341 B1).

### 2001-09 — 2002-09, Staff Engineer, Santa Clara, CA
* Team leader for JSF web application framework since early days of project. Leveraged extreme programming concepts to lead a three person team in tackling an ambitious, highly visible, project on an aggressive schedule. 

### 1997-01 — 2001-08, Staff Engineer, Santa Clara, CA
* Lead engineer for Java integration in the Netscape 6 web browser. Netscape 6 is several million lines of open source code. Deep knowledge of C++, Win32 internals, XPCOM, GNU/Linux, JNI, and Java.
* Designed and implemented an open source Java API to web browsing functionality. The API has implementations rooted in Netscape 6, ICE, and Internet Explorer. Several customers are using the webclient API in their custom products. The API also ships standard with Netscape 6.01 for Solaris.
* Was instrumental in conceiving and implementing a grass-roots CASE tool to gather software requirements. Utilized XML, XSL and servlet technologies to provide a web front end.
* Lead engineer for front end of 100% Pure Java multi-dimensional spreadsheet application.

## Silicon Graphics: 1995-06 — 1997-01, Core Engineer for Web Authoring Tool, Mountain View, CA

* Collaborated on a self-started two person team to design, implement and maintain a C++ web transport library. Drove the library from inception through two major releases. This library provides the foundation for SGI's web applications and ships on every SGI computer since IRIX 6.2.
* Integrated the web transport library into CosmoCreate to enable viewing and authoring pages over the web. This provided experience in extending legacy code well past initial requirements.

## National Center for Supercomputing Applications: 1994-08 — 1995-06, Developer for Mosaic for X, Champaign, IL

* Implemented enabling features for browsing and posting to the Common Client Interface (CCI) library. Added Perl interface to CCI, enabling perl programs to become web active.
* Conceived and implemented WebCast, a collaborative muticast (MBONE) program that enables sharing of web pages between Mosaic's all over the world using the CCI and the reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) library.

## International Business Machines: 1992-01 — 1994-05, Networking Systems division, Research Triangle Park, NC

* Contributed to CallPath Server digital telephony software for AIX and OS/2.
* Designed and implemented OS/2 based CASE system for automated System Testing.

# Technical Writer

Published Books with McGraw-Hill Professional

* Hudson Continuous Integration in Practice. Published: September 4th 2013 ISBN: 9780071804288

    * My most recent book is a practical guide to implementing continuous integration using Hudson, one of the pioneering tools in the field.

* JavaServer Faces 2.0, The Complete Reference. Published: November 2nd 2009 ISBN: 9780071625104

    * JSF 2.0 was a blockbuster release and introduced a large number of new and powerful features. This book was much more than an update of the first edition. More than two thirds of the content was brand new, documenting all of the new features.

* Secrets of the Rock Star Programmers: Riding the IT Crest. Published: February 21st 2008 ISBN: 9780071490832

    * This book is a collection of incisive interviews I conducted with some of the top practicing programmers of the day. I tried to discover and share the secrets of their professional success in technical, business, career, and personal domains. I continue to evolve this idea as a lecture, including new interviews with an expanding cadre of contemporary rock star programmers.

* JavaServer Faces: The Complete Reference. Published: August 25th 2006, ISBN: 9780071710480

    * My first book, at over 800 printed pages, is true to its title. It introduces JSF and provides a complete reference to all of its capabilities.

## Technical Blog

    http://ridingthecrest.com/blog/

Starting in 2004, My blog covers topics of interest to the practicing
programmer, mostly in Java, but also with higher level topics such as
REST, architecture, and industry analysis.

# Trainer and Developer Relations

I have over thirteen years of extensive international conference
speaking and training experience, having developed and delivered a broad
range of conference sessions and full day training workshops on a wide
array of software topics. I started with sessions and trainings on JSF
and J2EE in 2005 and continue in the present day with Docker,
Kubernetes, and cloud technologies.

A complete list of my sessions and training is at
