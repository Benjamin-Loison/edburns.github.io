      *OBJECTIVE*

Put my experience and education to work in a creatively challenging
organization dedicated to producing world-class software through
efficient application of software engineering practices.


      *EXPERIENCE*

Sun Microsystems:

      10/02 - present, /Senior Staff Engineer/, Santa Clara, CA

    * Help lead a team of industry experts from leading companies such
      as IBM, BEA, Sun, and Oracle in developing the specification for
      JavaServer Faces <http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/252.jsp> (JSF).
    * Pioneered techniques for using JSF and AJAX together.
    * Co-author of upcoming book /JavaServer Faces: The Complete
      Reference <http://purl.oclc.org/NET/jsfbook/>/.
    * Frequent Java.Net Blogger <http://weblogs.java.net/blog/edburns/>

      09/01 - 05/04, /Staff Engineer/, Santa Clara, CA

    * Team leader for JavaServer Faces web application framework
      <http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/> since early days of
      project. Leveraged extreme programming concepts to lead a three
      person team in tackling an ambitious, highly visible, project on
      an aggressive schedule.

      1/97 - 8/01, /Staff Engineer/, Santa Clara, CA

    * Lead engineer for Java integration <http://www.mozilla.org/oji/>
      in the Netscape 6 web browser. Netscape 6 is several million lines
      of open source code <http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/>. Deep
      knowledge of C++, Win32 internals, XPCOM, GNU/Linux, JNI, and Java.
    * Designed and implemented an open source Java API to web browsing
      functionality
      <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/webclient/>. The API
      has implementations rooted in Netscape 6, ICE, and Internet
      Explorer. Several customers are using the webclient API in their
      custom products. The API also ships standard with Netscape 6.01
      for Solaris.
    * Was instrumental in conceiving and implementing a grass-roots CASE
      tool to gather software requirements. Utilized XML, XSL and
      servlet technologies to provide a web front end.
    * Lead engineer for front end of 100% Pure Java multi-dimensional
      spreadsheet application. 

Silicon Graphics: 6/95-1/97, /Core Engineer for Web Authoring Tool/,
Mountain View, CA

    * Collaborated on a self-started two person team to design,
      implement and maintain a C++ web transport library. Drove the
      library from inception through two major releases. This library
      provides the foundation for SGI's web applications and ships on
      every SGI computer since IRIX 6.2.
    * Integrated the web transport library into CosmoCreate
      <http://www.sgi.com/software/cosmo/create.html> to enable viewing
      and authoring pages over the web. This provided experience in
      extending legacy code well past initial requirements. 

National Center for Supercomputing Applications: 8/94-6/95, /Developer
for Mosaic for X/, Champaign, IL

    * Implemented enabling features for browsing and posting to the
      Common Client Interface (CCI
      <http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/CCI/cci-spec.html>)
      library. Added Perl interface to CCI
      <http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/CCI/cci-perl.html>,
      enabling perl programs to become web active.
    * Conceived and implemented WebCast
      <http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/CCI/webcast.html>,
      a collaborative muticast (MBONE) program that enables sharing of
      web pages between Mosaic’s all over the world using the CCI and
      the reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) library. 

International Business Machines: 1/92-5/94, /Networking Systems
division/, Research Triangle Park, NC

    * Contributed to CallPath
      <http://www-3.ibm.com/software/speech/enterprise/ep_6.html> Server
      digital telephony software for AIX and OS/2.
    * Designed and implemented OS/2 based CASE system for automated
      System Testing. 


      *EDUCATION*

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, College of Engineering Co-Op
program, Computer Science Curriculum. Bachelor of Science in Computer
Science with International minor in Germanic Studies, emphasis on
computer music. *Degree Date: Spring 95*. GPA: 4.3/5.0
